Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Hou-Ting Jinora Kai Korra Mako Tenzin Yin Antagonists Dai Li Gombo's gang P'Li says: "Minor Chow Desna and Eska Gun Monorail conductor Oogi Naga Pabu Royal Palace servants San Tonraq Tu Upper-class men White Lotus sentries Zuko"
Tarrlok says: "Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace.  These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders.  Chief Beifong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership."
Mako says: "I still can't believe they're shutting this place down."
Bolin says: "Yeah. We had some good memories here, didn't we?"
Korra says: "Guys! Great news. You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!"
Mako says: "Oh, we'd love to, but ..."
Bolin says: "Asami already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion!  From here on out, it's gonna be the lap of luxury for us."
Asami says: "Oh hey, Korra, I was hoping you would stop by."
Korra says: "I was just leaving.  So, I guess I'll see you guys around, some time."
Asami says: "Why not tomorrow? I'd love to have you come visit the estate."
Korra says: "I don't know. I have some ... Avatar stuff to do."
Bolin says: "Come on, Korra.  We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness. We could swim in Asami's pool.  It'll be fun!"
Korra says: "All right, Pabu."
Asami says: "Great, we'll see you tomorrow."
