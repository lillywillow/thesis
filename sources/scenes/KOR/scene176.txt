Pema says: "Everyone, please settle down. The trains should be returning to pick us up soon."
Evacuee says: "Tell that mecha jerk to settle down. She's the one blowing up the whole city!"
Train conductor says: "I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that Kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks. We're not getting out of the city by rail."
Tu says: "Everyone! I was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mecha suit soldiers heading this way!"
Evacuee says: "Oh great! The giant one wasn't enough?! It's over! We're all gonna get blown to bits!"
Wu says: "Listen everyone, I can get us out of here if you just sit tight.  Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here."
Train conductor says: "Sure. I'm only the conductor. No one needs me on the bench."
Wu says: "Just stay calm. I'll be right back.  Come on."
Evacuee says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?"
Wu says: "I'm going to get some help.  You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?"
Pema says: "I raised Meelo. I can handle anything."
