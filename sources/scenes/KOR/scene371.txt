Mako says: "I can't believe it! The Upper Ring is in chaos!"
Looter says: "Don't try to stop us; we're taking back what's ours."
Royal Earthbender Guard says: "Stop you?  I'm gonna join you.  I know where the good stuff is."
Bolin says: "Should we do something?"
Mako says: "This isn't our battle.  We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately."
Bolin says: "Right. Okay, find Korra, deliver message.  Yeah, this should be easy. We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles.  This isn't gonna be easy."
Mako says: "We need an airship."
Mako says: "Excuse me, may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar."
Bolin says: "Let me give it a shot.  Hey, the Queen's gold's on the third floor of the palace, second door on the right!  You just got to know how to talk to 'em, bro."
Mako says: "What, they took everything. I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?"
Bolin says: "Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property.  Now let's steal this airship!"
Mako says: "You know how to fly this thing?"
Bolin says: "Technically speaking, no. But, c'mon, how hard could it be?"
Mako says: "Up! Up!"
Bolin says: "I don't see any up button. I see levers and switches, oh, there it is."
