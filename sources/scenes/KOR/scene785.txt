Varrick says: "Thank you all for  coming for the finale of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South"! You know, when I first started this project there were a lot of naysayers out there. "You can't make pictures move" they said. "You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star" they said.  "You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak" they said. Well, they're wrong! Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say.  They speak of the injustice that is happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.  My hope, is that their words, and this epic mover, will inspire a real life hero to rise up, and help.  Thank you again, enjoy the show!"
Voice narrator says: "When last we left our hero, he was captured by the Evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird.  Amazingly, with the power of his whistling, Nuktuk escaped.  And decided to seek out council."
