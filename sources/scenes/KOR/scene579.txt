Gun says: "Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!"
Wu says: "Where have you been? My coronation is in ten minutes!  Where's everyone else? Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?"
Gun says: "Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was  removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown."
Wu says: "There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown?  How will people know when I'm officially the king?"
Gun says: "We still have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you."
Wu says: "An earring?"
Gun says: "Think of it more as a royal brooch."
Wu says: "Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles? No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?"
Gun says: "It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your kingdom. Just try on the brooch, Your Grace, you will see it looks beautiful ..."
Wu says: "Don't ... touch me."
