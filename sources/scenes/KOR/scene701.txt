Korra says: "That's where Vaatu is."
Vaatu says: "So you've returned, Raava. The Harmonic Convergence is coming soon, and this time, I'm going to wipe you out for good."
Korra says: "I think you've said that before, Vaatu. But I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out."
Vaatu says: "You might want to reconsider- that is if you want to save your friend."
Korra says: "Jinora!  I can't believe I trusted you! You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!"
Unalaq says: "If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now."
Jinora says: "Don't do it Korra!"
Unalaq says: "What will it be? Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul forever?"
Korra says: "Stop! I'll do it.  Now let Jinora go. Ahhh!"
Unalaq says: "You should've come through the portal. Then you could do this!"
Jinora says: "Ahhh! Korra!"
Korra says: "Ahhh!"
Vaatu says: "I'll see you soon, Raava. Once the Harmonic Convergence comes, I'll be free from this prison, and then I will have my revenge!"
