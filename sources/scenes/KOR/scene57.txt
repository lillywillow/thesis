Wu says: "Hoo! I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that."
Asami says: "I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?"
Mako says: "Things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?"
Asami says: "Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later."
Mako says: "Asami!"
Wu says: "Ouch!"
Mako says: "Yep. Turns out, she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits."
