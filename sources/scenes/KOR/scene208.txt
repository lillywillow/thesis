Northern soldier says: "Everyone, clear the streets! Get back in your homes."
Korra says: "Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?"
Unalaq says: "Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm."
Korra says: "I can protect it."
Unalaq says: "I need you for something more important. There is another portal, in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds."
Korra says: "But, the solstice is over. How am I going to open it?"
Unalaq says: "The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well."
Korra says: "With both portals open, our tribes will be united again."
Unalaq says: "The world will be united again."
Tenzin says: "Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since-  Aaand, it's over."
Bumi says: "Gooood morning, Universe."
Kya says: "Bumi, please, cover yourself."
Bumi says: "Well, lookee here, "Vacation Tenzin" has finally decided to join us."
Tenzin says: "Yes, he has.  It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family.  Isn't that right, my little Rohan?  And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad."
Kya says: "Uhh, I think your memory's a little foggy.  Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad."
Tenzin says: "No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?"
Kya says: "Nope, we weren't there."
Tenzin says: "Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach."
Bumi says: "You mean, you built? We never saw the place."
Tenzin says: "I could've sworn."
