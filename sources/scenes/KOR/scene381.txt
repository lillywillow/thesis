Zaheer says: "Good. The entire family is here."
Zaheer says: "It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master."
Tenzin says: "What is it you want from us?"
Zaheer says: "Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed."
Tenzin says: "Then what are you doing here?"
Zaheer says: "I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her."
Tenzin says: "You're using us as leverage."
Zaheer says: "Yes."
Tenzin says: "I will never let you get to Korra."
Zaheer says: "Unfortunately, you don't have a choice."
Tenzin says: "Yes, I do."
Tenzin says: "Jinora! Get everyone out of here. Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off!  And stay out of her line of sight! Go, go!"
