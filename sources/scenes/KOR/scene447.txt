Spectator says: "Look! It's Bolin!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets. Let's see if we can get a quick interview. Bolin!  Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season. How have you been spending your time lately?"
Bolin says: "Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ...  But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City! Am I right, people? Republic City!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Do you miss being in the ring?"
Bolin says: "Well, I definitely don't miss getting hit with things all the time, and the humiliating losing. I mean, that gets pretty old. You know, sometimes I actually cry myself to sleep ...  I guess what I miss the most are these fans! They're the greatest fans in the world! Give it up for the fans!"
Varrick says: "Look how these people love you, kid! They're eating that cornball spiel right out of your hand."
Bolin says: "The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say "Republic City" or "fans", and then everyone cheers."
Varrick says: "I think I just figured out your true calling."
