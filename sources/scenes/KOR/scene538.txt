Korra says: "I think I'm doing it wrong."
Tenzin says: "There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free,  for air is the element of freedom.  Is something ... funny?"
Korra says: "Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom, but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island!"
Tenzin says: "Please, Korra.  Look at Meelo; he's able to meditate peacefully."
Korra says: "Actually, I think he's asleep."
Tenzin says: "What? Well, at least he has the relaxing part down."
Korra says: "Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me."
Tenzin says: "I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day, they'll just click."
Korra says: "Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.  I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice."
Tenzin says: "Korra, the meditation's not over yet!"
Ikki says: "Daddy, can I have some lychee juice too?"
Tenzin says: "No."
