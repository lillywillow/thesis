Shiro Shinobi says: "Avatar Korra has lost her memory! In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar. Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire. But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation. Will he be able to stop him?"
Karu says: "Should we pull her up?"
Shaman says: "No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories.  She must confront her own past if she is to move forward.  We can only hope that she survives her ordeal."
Raava says: "The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation.  And it's all your fault.  This is why humans have no place  interfering in the business of spirits."
Wan says: "This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business."
Raava says: "Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late."
Wan says: "Let me help you."
Raava says: "I don't want your help.  Don't interfere with me again, human!"
Wan says: "Let's get moving."
