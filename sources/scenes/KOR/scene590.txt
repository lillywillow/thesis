Law clerk says: "This trial will now come to order! Judge Hotah presiding."
Bolin says: "Man! I should have paid him!"
Asami says: "Yeah, you think?"
Unalaq says: "I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me."
Hotah says: "According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?"
Korra says: "Yes."
Hotah says: "And where these men present at that meeting?"
Korra says: "Well, yes, but -"
Hotah says: "And where exactly did this meeting take place?"
Bolin says: "Objection!"
Hotah says: "Quiet down out there! I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?"
Korra says: "My parents' house."
Hotah says: "And who led this meeting?"
Bolin says: "Your honor, if I may?"
Hotah says: "May what?"
Bolin says: "May I ... declare a mistrial?"
Hotah says: "Sit down!  Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?"
Korra says: "My parents are innocent!"
Hotah says: "I've heard all I need to. I'll return shortly with my decision."
Bolin says: "Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk."
Eska says: "I grant you permission to speak freely."
Bolin says: "Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading."
Eska says: "I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it."
Bolin says: "Oh! Oh, yes! I'm so glad you understand!"
Eska says: "Nothing, that is, except marriage.  We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears."
Bolin says: "Oh, no, I can't -  This is really tight."
