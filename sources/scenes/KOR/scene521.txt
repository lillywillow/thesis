Bolin says: "Opal, you made it!"
Opal says: "What's this?"
Bolin says: "A picnic, just for the two of us! Well, the three of us. Sorry, Pabs."
Opal says: "So, this note Pabu brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?"
Bolin says: "Maybe ... but now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax, try some of my homemade steam buns  —Pema's recipe—and watch Pabu do some of his world-famous backflips for entertainment? Ha-hah!"
Opal says: "Oh. Steam buns. My favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now. So yeah, let's just sit down and have a great picnic because we're so in love!  I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu."
