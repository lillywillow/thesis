Bumi says: "Morning, kids!"
Meelo says: "Morning, Uncle Bumi!  Do you have a baby in there?"
Pema says: "Where's your sister?"
Jinora says: "Who?"
Pema says: "Ikki. About this tall.  Talks real fast. I'm sure you know her."
Jinora says: "Uhh ..."
Meelo says: "There was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming. Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid!"
Bumi says: "The shark-squid? He's here? It appears my old nemesis has found me."
Pema says: "Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?"
Jinora says: "I don't know.  Maybe.  Yes."
Meelo says: "She ran away."
Pema says: "Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along!"
Tenzin says: "It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far.,  I'll find her."
Bumi says: "Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty."
Kya says: "What do you say we all go together?"
Tenzin says: "Sure, I could use the help."
Bumi says: "When I get back, we'll come out with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all!"
Meelo says: "Yeah!"
