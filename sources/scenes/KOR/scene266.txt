Mako says: "Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches."
Asami says: "Forget them. What's this idea of yours?"
Mako says: "A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it."
Asami says: "Let's do it."
Mako says: "It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no."
Asami says: "We can make it work, just the two of us."
Mako says: "I don't know. I don't want to go behind Beifong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force."
Asami says: "Mako, I need your help. My Mom is gone. My Dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family."
Mako says: "I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship."
Varrick says: "You need a ship? I got a ship. I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans."
Asami says: "The less you know, the better."
Varrick says: "Perfect! I love not knowing things."
Mako says: "All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys."
