Korra says: "Ugh, I can't bend.  I can't bend!"
Mako says: "Calm down, it'll wear off.  Those guys were chi blockers.  They're Amon's henchmen."
Korra says: "Amon?  That anti-bending guy with a mask?"
Mako says: "Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists."
Korra says: "What do they want with the Triple Threats?"
Mako says: "Whatever it is,  can't be good.  Urgh, can't believe Bolin got himself into this mess!"
Korra says: "Mako,  we are going to save your brother.  I promise you that."
Korra says: "We've been out all night.  No sign of him."
Mako says: "We've gotta keep looking. But where?"
Korra says: "Huh!  I have an idea!"
Korra says: "The first day I got into town, I ran into an Equalist protester  over there."
Mako says: "And you think they'll know where Bolin is?"
Korra says: "It's our only lead right now."
Korra says: "So, why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?"
Mako says: "Well, we ... we used to do some work for them back in the day."
Korra says: "What? Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?"
Mako says: "No! You don't know what you're talking about. I just ran numbers for them and stuff. We were orphans out on the street; I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother."
Korra says: "I'm sorry. It must have been really hard.  Can I ask what happened to your parents?"
Mako says: "They were mugged, by a firebender. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight."
Korra says: "Mako ..."
Mako says: "Bolin's the only family I have left. If anything happened to him ..."
