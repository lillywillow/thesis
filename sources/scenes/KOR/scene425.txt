Bumi says: "You in the Spirit World yet?"
Tenzin says: "No, I am not,  and stop bugging me."
Kya says: "It's okay, Tenzin. Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the Spirit World."
Tenzin says: "No! Just give me some time."
Kya says: "Stop being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar."
Tenzin says: "Jinora will not enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am. I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World."
Korra says: "Tenzin, we're running out of time."
Tenzin says: "If everyone could just be quiet and let me  focus."
Jinora says: "Aunt Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right."
Tenzin says: "Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have."
Jinora says: "It's okay, Daddy."
Tenzin says: "I'm proud of you.  Go. Close the portal. We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return."
Korra says: "We'll be all right."
