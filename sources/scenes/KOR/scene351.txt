Mako says: "The truck with Bolin took off down this alley."
Asami says: "Which way?"
Bolin says: "Hmm. This way kinda ...  smells familiar."
Lin says: "There's a tunnel nearby."
Mako says: "There!"
Lin says: "Motorcycle tracks."
Mako says: "Korra has to be in there ... somewhere."
Mako says: "Let's try this way."
Asami says: "And what if Korra's not down there?"
Mako says: "Then we pick another tunnel until we find her!"
