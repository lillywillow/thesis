Korra says: "Naga found something.  Oh ... Sorry, I forgot to bring treats  but, good girl."
Asami says: "This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far."
Mako says: "Bolin and I  will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there."
Bolin says: "Yes!  I love it when you talk like a cop."
Korra says: "I'm coming too."
Mako says: "No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves."
Korra says: "All right."
Bolin says: "Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako! We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover! That way,  no one will recognize us. Haha, police work is so exciting!"
