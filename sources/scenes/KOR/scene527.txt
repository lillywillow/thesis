Tenzin says: "That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending."
Korra says: "Come on, Tenzin! I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid  and now I'm just a ferry ride away from  the arena."
Tenzin says: "Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel. You're here to finish your Avatar training.  So, for the time being, I want you to remain on the island."
Korra says: "Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around,  to watch my every move?"
Tenzin says: "Yes. In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm,  quiet environment, free from any distractions."
Korra says: "All right,  you're the master."
