Bolin says: "How about you use your own legs for a while?"
Varrick says: "You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li, she carried me twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle."
Bolin says: "Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?"
Varrick says: "That's fine, leave me here, let the worms gobble me up. I deserve it."
Bolin says: "No way mister! You're not getting off that easily. You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people."
Varrick says: "No, don't remind me! I know, I'm a horrible, horrible person!"
Bolin says: "Okay, look. Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either. But, you know how we're gonna make it up to the world? By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to! So, I want you to take my hand  and march with me out of this forest!"
Varrick says: "You really have a way with words, kid. No wonder I made you a mover star. All right, I'll take the driver's seat for a while, hop on."
Bolin says: "Oh, great, my feet could use a break."
Varrick says: "Oh, boy, here we go!"
Bolin says: "Are you kidding me?!"
