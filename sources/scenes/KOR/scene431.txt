Male reporter #1 says: "Mr President, are you concerned that your approval ratings are now nearly as low as the Avatar's?  Have you seen today's headline? It says "Raik-oh no. Polls pan pres' plans"."
Raiko says: "I'm not concerned with snappy put-downs in the press. I'm facing this calamity just like every other citizen.  There's a tree growing right through my office. You think I'm not doing everything I can to get rid of it?"
Reporters says: "Avatar Korra, few questions please."
Male reporter #2 says: "Avatar Korra, do you regret the way you handled the Unalaq Crisis?"
Female reporter #1 says: "Why are you forcing the integration of spirits in Republic City?"
Korra says: "Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of to get rid of these vines, but-"
Male reporter #3 says: "Why can't you fix this?"
Male reporter #4 says: "Are the vines here to stay?"
Female reporter #2 says: "Is this part of your New World Order?"
Korra says: "Look, Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago. I just needed a little more time to get everything back to normal."
Raiko says: "The Avatar has put us all in a very difficult position, but my administration-"
Korra says: "Oh, I'm sorry. Did I put you in a difficult position by fighting the giant force of pure evil that was going to destroy the whole world?  Maybe your administration could have handled that."
Lin says: "That's all, no more questions."
Korra says: "This is a disaster."
Asami says: "Don't worry, we'll figure something out."
Korra says: "Easy for you to say. You don't have my poll numbers. Eight percent approval? Who are they asking?"
Asami says: "You can't take that to heart. People are just frustrated."
Korra says: "I don't blame them. I should be able to fix this. I'm the Avatar."
