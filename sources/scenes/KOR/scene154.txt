Wan says: "Get off me! Get off me!"
Aye-aye spirit says: "You are not welcome in my oasis, human."
Wan says: "Please, help me. I'm starving and I haven't slept all night."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Not my problem."
Wan says: "Let me pass."
Aye-aye spirit says: "You dare use fire against me?  Now, be gone with you!"
Aye-aye spirit says: "And who might you be?"
Wan says: "I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit. And I would like the enter your oasis."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Very well.  You may pass.  Wait a second.  Something stinks.  I knew I smelled a human!"
Wan says: "Come on, let me in, just for a little while."
Aye-aye spirit says: "No! Go back to your lion turtle."
Wan says: "Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "That's too bad."
Friendly spirit #2 says: "Poor human."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Don't pity him. He's just like every other human: ugly, destructive, and lacking any respect for nature."
Wan says: "Who are you calling ugly, Ugly?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Mmm."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "If you can't go back to your city, then you should go live in another one."
Wan says: "What? There are other lion turtles?"
Aye-aye spirit says: ""There are other lion turtles?"  Of course there are,  dozens of them! Boy, you humans are stupid, too."
Wan says: "So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Hmm. I think it's on the other side of none-of-your-business valley."
Wan says: "Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself."
Friendly spirit #2 says: "Good luck!"
Wan says: "It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of there."
