Ikki says: "No fair! You can't go into the Avatar State to win!"
Tenzin says: "You did what!?  The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket! You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate!"
Korra says: "It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?"
Tenzin says: "Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending."
Korra says: "I have mastered airbending!  Punch punch punch!  See?  Mastered."
