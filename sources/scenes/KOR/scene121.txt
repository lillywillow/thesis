Bolin says: "All right, let's do this!  Saving the Beifongs and saving our love, because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us and make us whole again!"
Lin Beifong says: "You. Zip it. Now. I had enough of your babble on the way in."
Bolin says: "Yes, ma'am."
Opal says: "Kuvira tore down all the domes. Why would she do that?"
Lin says: "She's got a whole battalion of troops stationed there. There's no way we'll be able to spot anything useful from here. We'll have to go in for a closer look."
Toph says: "Don't bother. All the prisoners have been moved."
Lin says: "Uh ... hey, Chief."
Toph says: "Hey, Chief."
Opal says: "Grandma Toph!"
Toph says: "You were only up to my waist the last time we were together."
Bolin says: "Oh, man! Ohh, I can't. This can't be happening!"
Toph says: "What?! Do you have to pee or something?"
Bolin says: "No ... well, now, maybe. You're my hero! My name is Bolin. I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of. I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?"
Toph says: "What's up with him?"
Lin says: "He's an actor. So, you already checked the city for Su? How did you know she was captured?"
Toph says: "I've been living in the swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines."
Bolin says: "Sure, okay, makes sense."
Toph says: "By the time I got here, they were gone. I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp."
Opal says: "Where would that be?"
Bolin says: "There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away."
Toph says: "How do you know that?"
Opal says: "Bolin used to work for Kuvira."
Toph says: "How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick who works for Kuvira?"
Bolin says: ""Used to"!"
Lin says: "It's not his silver tongue, I can tell you that."
Bolin says: "Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary."
