White Lotus sentry says: "You know the drill, Zaheer."
Zaheer says: "Of course."
White Lotus sentry says: "Hope you still like rice."
Zaheer says: "Have you ever read the poetry of the great airbending guru, Laghima?"
White Lotus sentry says: "What?"
Zaheer says: "Guru Laghima lived four thousand years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secret of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth, living his final forty years without ever touching the ground."
White Lotus sentry says: "Is that how you plan to escape? With something you picked up from an old airbender children's story?"
Zaheer says: "Like all great children's tales, it contains truth within the myth. Laghima once wrote: "Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong.""
White Lotus sentry says: "What's that supposed to mean?"
Zaheer says: "It means that when you base your expectations only on what you see,  you blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality."
Zaheer says: "Uh, uh, uh. You wouldn't want to singe your friend, would you?"
White Lotus sentry says: "How? You're not a ... bender."
Zaheer says: "Nature is constantly changing. Like the wind."
Zaheer says: "Now you might want to ration that bowl of rice. You've got three weeks until the next shift change. It's the dawning of a new age. The end of the White Lotus, and soon, the end of the Avatar."
Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Daw Korra Lin Beifong Mako Tenzin Antagonists Zaheer says: "Minor Daw's brother Fruithog Ikki Jinora Kya Meelo Pema President Raiko Rohan White Lotus sentries"
Shiro Shinobi says: "It's brother versus brother in the war of the Water Tribes. After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war. The Southern rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered, so Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid. But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?"
