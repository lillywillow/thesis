Bolin says: "Fwoo, I'm getting really hungry.  Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old,  fruit stand scam. Come on.  You remember how it goes,  I push you into the stand,  you scream.  I pretend to faint."
Mako says: "I don't want any part of it. Besides, look at this fruit,  it's disgusting. We don't want to steal this."
Tu says: "Hey,  you trying to steal my fruit?"
Mako says: "No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit."
Tu says: "Oh, you're too good for my fruit?  This is the best fruit on the block."
Mako says: "So you want me to steal it?"
Tu says: "Just try me, buddy.  Go ahead."
Bolin says: "I'm confused. Are we stealing the fruit or not?"
Tu says: "I knew it.  Thieves!"
Chow says: "What's going on here?"
Tu says: "Dad, these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit."
Chow says: "Bolin? Mako?"
Mako says: "How do you know our names?"
Bolin says: "Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?"
Chow says: "You look just like San.  Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are. They're your cousins! My brother San's kids."
