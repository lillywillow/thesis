Two Toed Ping says: "And that's why they call me  Two Toed Ping."
Asami says: "Because you have two extra toes."
Two Toed Ping says: "That's right. And there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side."
Mako says: "Wait, guys. Do you hear that?"
Asami says: "I didn't hear anything."
Two Toed Ping says: "No."
Mako says: "Ah! What's taking so long?"
Two Toed Ping says: "You just gotta relax, like me. Maybe try taking your shoes off."
Mako says: "I'm gonna check it out."
Shady Shin says: "So how long do we have to stay out here?"
Viper says: "I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?"
Shady Shin says: "Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best. I gotta shower and shave. I have a whole routine, okay?"
Viper says: "Well, your date's gonna have to wait."
Shady Shin says: "She's not gonna be happy about that."
Viper says: "Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame  distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do."
Shady Shin says: "See? This is why I never get dates."
