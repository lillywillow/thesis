Light spirit says: "Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!"
Skeptical spirit says: "You sure? I don't sense any Raava energy around her. Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar. And, doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?"
Korra says: "Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate here. And yes, I am the Avatar. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair."
Light spirit says: "See? I told you guys it was her!  How come you've been away so long?"
Korra says: "I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit."
Skeptical spirit says: "No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy."
Korra says: "I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working.  The last time I was here, I saw all sorts of visions.  Now I don't see anything."
Light spirit says: "Maybe we can help you get better."
Korra says: "I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better.  Nothing's worked.  I need to figure this out on my own."
