Bolin says: "Work with me here, Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?  So, what do you think of Korra, in a "girlfriend" sort of way?"
Mako says: "She's great! But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami."
Bolin says: "I was talking about a girlfriend for me! Leave some ladies for the rest of us!"
Mako says: "I know, that's what I thought you meant."
Bolin says: "Well ...?"
Mako says: "I don't know, Bo. It doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra."
Bolin says: "You just said she was great two seconds ago."
Mako says: "Yeah, Korra is a great athlete and the Avatar and stuff, but I don't know if she's really "girlfriend material". She's more like a pal."
Bolin says: "Bro, you're nuts! Korra and I are perfect for each other: she's strong, I'm strong; she's fun, I'm fun; she's beautiful, I'm gorgeous! Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out."
Mako says: "Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?"
Bolin says: "Yeah, yeah, I know, gah.  You know what I'm talking about, Pabu, I'm talking about real love."
