Bolin says: "Naga away!"
Korra says: "All right, scratch that.  Any other ideas?"
Asami says: "Hmm.  I think I have the answer."
Asami says: "You think this'll do?"
Mako says: "I like the new Team Avatar's style."
Police dispatcher says: "Unit two sixteen, cancel that ten fifty-eight at Harmony Tower. Come back to the station, over."
Asami says: "My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why."
Police dispatcher says: "Calling all units, Level Four Alert. Jailbreak at headquarters. Officers down, electrocuted. Chi blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large armed and dangerous.  Last seen heading east. I repeat, Level Four Alert. Equalist jailbreak!"
Bolin says: "Chi blockers!"
Mako says: "That's them!"
Korra says: "Let's get 'em!"
Asami says: "Korra! Bolin! Give me a ramp! Now!"
Asami says: "Help me out! We gotta make this turn!"
Asami says: "They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready."
Tarrlok says: "Avatar Korra, what do you think you are doing?"
Korra says: "Oh, hey Tarrlok. Nice of you to show up finally. Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you."
Tarrlok says: "What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals."
Korra says: "Hmm, that's funny.  I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.  If it wasn't for Team Avatar,  they would've gotten away."
Tarrlok says: "This is your last warning. Stay out of my way!"
