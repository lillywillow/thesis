Asami says: "There you go. All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance.  Take a look."
Korra says: "It's great. Thanks."
Asami says: "You know, nobody expects you to bounce back right away. It's only been two weeks. You need time to heal.  I want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever want to talk, or, anything. But let's just try to enjoy this today; for Jinora."
Korra says: "You're right.  Okay, let's go."
Tonraq says: "You look beautiful, sweetie."
Tenzin says: "You're looking stronger everyday, Korra."
Raiko says: "I'd like to officially welcome you back to Republic City. I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms. But I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists."
Asami says: "We should go inside."
Ikki says: "I-I can help."
Meelo says: "I want to ride with Korra.  Jinora's already inside. Smells like shoe trees."
Ikki says: "Sandalwood, Meelo."
Lin says: "I got this.  Hang in there, kid."
Raiko says: "She's not looking good."
Tonraq says: "Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had."
Tenzin says: "She'll be fine. She just needs time to heal. The poison took a great toll."
Raiko says: "Of course. I'm just saying, with the Earth Kingdom in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen ..."
Zuko says: "And even with Zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many Red Lotus members might be out there, hiding."
Raiko says: "Exactly. With the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now more than ever. Who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair?"
