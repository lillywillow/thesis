Korra says: "I know that Earth Queen  is lying to me!  I can tell by that stupid little queenly smirk of hers! I can't believe I helped her. I should have known she was using me!"
Asami says: "Hey, I think I can use a break. You letting off steam is starting to,  hurt. A lot."
Korra says: "Sorry."
Asami says: "Mako. Bolin. You're okay. Where have you been?"
Bolin says: "We chased Kai. Train. Slipped away. Lower Ring. Slept in trash pile. Met our family. Grandma tears. Mako scarf.  Earth Queen. Lying."
Asami says: "Can you interpret that?"
Mako says: "The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and forcing them into her army."
Korra says: "She was lying. I knew it! I swear, the next time I see her-"
Asami says: "It's the Queen."
Bolin says: "Quick! Pabu. Shirt.  I know. Sorry. Kinda sweaty."
Hou-Ting says: "Good. You're here. Gun, tell them the news."
Gun says: "We've received word from the Yang Province. There have been reports of airbenders there."
Hou-Ting says: "Wonderful, isn't it? It's the very thing you've been looking for."
Korra says: "Thank you! That is just the most wonderful news. Ever. Yay."
Hou-Ting says: "So, I assume you and your  friends here will be leaving immediately.  Is there an animal in my presence?"
Gun says: "N-no, Your Majesty. I would never allow an animal near you."
Hou-Ting says: "If I find one within fifty feet of me, it's your head.  Anyway, if you need any assistance packing, let Gun know. He'll see to it that you're on your way by evening."
Korra says: "Uhh, this evening? I'm not sure about leaving so soon-"
Asami says: "Because our airship is having engine trouble. It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs."
Korra says: "Thanks for buying us some time."
