Vaatu says: "Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all."
Wan says: "Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me."
Vaatu says: "No human can stand against me."
Wan says: "Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore."
Vaatu says: "I lived ten thousand lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud!"
Vaatu says: "It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!  To hate me is to give me breath. To fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!"
Wan says: "Raava! The only way to win is together.  Ah!"
Raava says: "I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die."
Wan says: "It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!"
Vaatu says: "The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over."
