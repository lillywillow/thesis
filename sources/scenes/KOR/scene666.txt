Eska says: "What are we still doing here, Father?"
Desna says: "The invasion was completely successful and the southern tribe is under our control. The spirit portals are open."
Eska says: "You've restored balance. Now we would like to go home."
Unalaq says: "You don't understand. Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish."
Desna says: "What else is there? The Water Tribe is united."
Unalaq says: "After today, there will be no more Water Tribe; no more nations of any kind.  The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent, and new.  And I will lead this glorious revolution. Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal."
Eska says: "From whom? We've already beaten everyone."
Unalaq says: "The Avatar will be here soon. She has no choice ..."
