Zaheer says: "You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope.  But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the old world and plant seeds for a new world to flourish."
Korra says: "Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it."
Zaheer says: "You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar."
Korra says: "Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo! I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?"
Zaheer says: "You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now. See you in the physical world."
Korra says: "Zaheer!  Zaheer, you tricked me! Let me go!  Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?"
Asami says: "What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did."
Korra says: "Where are we?"
Asami says: "I'm not sure. Some camp by the desert. They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se."
