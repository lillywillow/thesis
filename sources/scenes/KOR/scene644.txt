Yin says: "This is the only letter we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation, and had two wonderful sons. He sent this picture of you all on his birthday."
Bolin says: "Look, Mako! Dad's wearing your scarf!"
Yin says: "I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother,  but you have her eyes. I know from looking at you two that she must have been a wonderful bride for my boy."
Mako says: "I'm sure they would want you to have this."
