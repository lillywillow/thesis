Wan says: "Great lion turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late."
Air lion turtle says: "You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time."
Wan says: "I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it."
Air lion turtle says: "Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it."
Raava says: "Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?"
Wan says: "Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance."
Raava says: "You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air."
Wan says: "Thank you. And in return I will help you restore balance to the world."
