White Lotus leader says: "Do you believe she's ready, Master Katara?"
Katara says: "Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, it's Tenzin."
White Lotus leader says: "Very well, Korra. It's time for you to begin your airbending training."
Korra says: "Yes! Finally!  I mean,  thank you all for believing in me."
Korra says: "Naga, you should have seen it!  I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed!  Tenzin will be here in a few days."
