Bumi says: "You're not gonna believe what just happened. Where's your father?"
Ikki says: "Dad!"
Tenzin says: "What is it? What's wrong?"
Bumi says: "The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred. Okay,  Bum-Ju and I had a little fight.  I made him this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it, and I'll admit, it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting, so I was a little hurt."
Tenzin says: "Hilarious.  Time for dinner, everyone."
Bumi says: "No, check this out.  I can airbend.  Yeah wait, seriously, I was doing it.  No hold on, I just uh, maybe if I-  No.  I swear, I'm not making it up."
Tenzin says: "Stop waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore."
Bumi says: "It's not a joke."
Korra says: "What's up with him?"
Bolin says: "Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now. Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either.  I gotta say, I love being a part of this family.  You got the grumpy dad,  the wacky uncle,  the put-upon mom,  crazy kids. Well, that's just great."
Asami says: "Where's Mako?"
Bolin says: "Oh, you mean the brooding teenager? He's staying in the police station."
Korra says: "Still?"
Bolin says: "I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but,  he said he had to focus on work."
Bumi says: "Oh, did you see that? I think the napkin moved."
Kya says: "You blew on it."
Bumi says: "Wait!  Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. Bolin, bend a giant boulder at me."
Bolin says: "Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea."
Pema says: "If you're going to be bending giant boulders, you can do it outside."
Tenzin says: "No one is bending giant boulders!"
Meelo says: "Look alive, Uncle Bumi!"
Bumi says: "I told you!"
Tenzin says: "Unbelievable. You're actually an airbender."
Bumi says: "Wait 'till I tell Mom, she's gonna love this."
Mako says: "Ow!  Police. He what? Slow down. Okay, I'm on my way."
