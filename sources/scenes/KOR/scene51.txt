Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Kai Korra Mako Tenzin Antagonists Ming-Hua Ghazan Zaheer says: "Minor Ikki Kuon Kya Meelo Pema Rohan Ryu Ryu's mother White Lotus sentries Zuko"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Avatar Korra is back, and yours truly, Shiro Shinobi, couldn't be more thrilled! It's been my honor to bring you news of Korra and her friends over the years; so many heart-pounding moments! Who can forget Amon and his Equalist revolution? I still have nightmares! Then there was the time I covered the Nuktuk mover premiere! Boy, was that fun! But enough about me. Sit back, relax, and take a trip down memory lane!"
Wu says: "You know, there's something about being kidnapped that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together."
Mako says: "Yeah, I agree. Let's toughen you up."
Wu says: "Daaah, I wasn't ready!  Wu down!"
Yin says: "What's going on?  Mako, how dare you injure the prince! Would his royal highness like a cherry-berry lemonade?"
Wu says: "And maybe some of those sticky dumplings, too?"
Mako says: "Look at you! You're so weak, "Wu down" is your catchphrase."
Wu says: "I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault, I was born that way! I'm not like you Mako, I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods."
Mako says: "You don't know anything about me, do you?"
Wu says: "Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that? How do I not know stuff about you?"
Mako says: "Uhh ... you never asked?"
Wu says: "Well, I'm asking now!  What's your favorite food? What's your favorite color? Is there a special lady in your life?"
Mako says: "Not since Korra and I broke up."
Wu says: "What? You dated the Avatar?  Sit!  You and I need to have a little gab session right now!  How'd you guys first meet?"
