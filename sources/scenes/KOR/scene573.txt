Tenzin says: "Thank goodness.  I was just about to send out a search party.  Are you all right?  Korra, what happened? Did you find your friend?"
Korra says: "Yes, but ...  I was at an Equalist rally.  I saw Amon."
Tenzin says: "What?"
Korra says: "He can take people's bending away.  For good."
Tenzin says: "That's ...  that's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability."
Korra says: "But I saw him do it."
Tenzin says: "I believe you.  I don't know how Amon has achieved this power, but this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever.  No bender is safe."

Shiro Shinobi says: "So much has changed these past three years! Mako is a bodyguard for the future Earth King, Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira, the Earth Kingdom's interim leader, who has brought stability to a nation plagued by chaos. Meanwhile, after wandering the world trying to heal herself, a spirit led Korra to the swamp, where she met Toph Beifong. Will this earthbending master be the key to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?"
