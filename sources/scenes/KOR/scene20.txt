Shiro Shinobi says: "Wait a second folks.  Toza looks like he's suddenly waking up from a bad dream.  He's blasting away  just like the championship season 10 years ago.  The legend's still got it.  Knockout!"
Bolin says: "Yes. He listened to me, Mako. I told him not to throw the fight  and he listened."
Shady Shin says: "You what?!"
Bolin says: "Oh, well, you know, I'm sure there are other factors."
Lightning Bolt Zolt says: "All right, enough, enough.  You look ridiculous, fighting with kids. It's not dignified.  And you; what gives? You cost me a lot of money just now. I thought you were an honorable man."
Toza says: "I am an honorable man. I just needed someone  to remind me.  Here's your money back. Now get out of my gym."
Shady Shin says: "Lets go, boys. We're gonna talk about this when we get back to the hideout."
Toza says: "Wait. You guys have got some real bending skills. With a little training, I think you could go pro. I could teach you everything I know."
Shady Shin says: "Sorry bum, but at least one of these kids is too smart to end up like you, right Mako?"
Toza says: "I could find you a place to stay right here in the arena. Who knows, you could be champs. At least it's a chance at an honest living."
Bolin says: "Can we, Mako? Mako, can we please?"
Shady Shin says: "Don't go soft on me, Mako. Remember, it's up to you to take care of your little brother. Use your head, make the smart play."
Mako says: "Sorry Shady, but you're right. I do have to take care of my brother, and I think this is what's best for him."
Shady Shin says: "Suit yourself. But who knows, maybe we can fix a fight together, some time."
Bolin says: "I'm so glad we're not criminals anymore. Lets celebrate over dinner."
Mako says: "Err, I think we better save our money."
Bolin says: "Oh, I have lots of money coming. I bet everything we had on the Boar-q-pines."
Mako says: "What?! But you knew the fight was fixed."
Bolin says: "What can I say?  I had a good feeling."
