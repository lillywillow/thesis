Bolin says: "Now don't take this the wrong way, but, I can't wait for you to leave!"
Mako says: "How else is she supposed to take that but the wrong way?"
Bolin says: "I mean, because I've never had a pen pal before!  I'm gonna write so many letters and, just to get the ball rolling, here.  Spoiler alert: Pabu and I already miss you."
Korra says: "Thanks. That's sweet."
Asami says: "Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you."
Korra says: "No ... I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks.  A little time alone will be good for me."
