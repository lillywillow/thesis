Mako says: "Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be."
Korra says: "Of course you take his side."
Mako says: "I'm not taking his side."
Korra says: "You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on."
Mako says: "There aren't any sides!"
Korra says: "How could you take his side?"
Mako says: "What's with you and sides?"
Korra says: "Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets! I'm just trying to save the world!"
Mako says: "Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!"
Korra says: "So, what? Are you ... breaking up with me?"
Mako says: "Yeah ... I guess I am."
Wu says: "Now that's a breakup!"
Mako says: "After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.  The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night.  Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us. We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out."
