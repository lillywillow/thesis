Korra says: "In my head, I saw that playing out very differently."
Asami says: "Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us."
Bolin says: "Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship."
Bumi says: "That's how they got me to join the United Forces."
Tenzin says: "No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about."
Tenzin says: "When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me.  There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.  I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable.  You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any.  You'll get to shave your head.  Your best friend will be a giant bison!"
Tenzin says: "Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy. Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?"
Bumi says: "It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender."
Korra says: "Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding. It's time for a little tough love."
