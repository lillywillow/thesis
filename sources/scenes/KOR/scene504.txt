Aiwei says: "That won't be necessary."
Lin says: "Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?"
Korra says: "Lin, stop! Your sister was not involved!"
Suyin says: "No,  I'll gladly be questioned. I have nothing to hide."
Aiwei says: "What is your full name?"
Suyin says: "Suyin Beifong. I'm the daughter of Toph and  the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night."
Aiwei says: "She is telling  the truth."
Korra says: "This is a waste of time! Just bring in the next guard!"
Aiwei says: "Give me your name and tell me where you are from."
Hong Li says: "I'm Hong Li. I was born and raised here in Zaofu."
Aiwei says: "Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?"
Hong Li says: "No."
Aiwei says: "Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?"
Hong Li says: "No, of course not."
Aiwei says: "You're lying."
Hong Li says: "What?! No, I'm not!"
Suyin says: "How did they get in and out?  Where are they now?"
Hong Li says: "I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't help them!"
Suyin says: "You're a traitor to the entire clan!"
Aiwei says: "I suggest we search his place."
Mako says: "I got something!"
Bolin says: "What?"
Mako says: "It looks like it's from them.  "Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous.""
Asami says: "And look at this."
Aiwei says: "These are the guards' logbooks. All their schedules and routes are in here."
Korra says: "That guard knows everything.  We have to get him to talk."
Mako says: "Let's go confront him with this evidence right now."
Aiwei says: "No.  Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually."
