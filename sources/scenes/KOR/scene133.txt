Bolin says: "I got you!"
Kuvira says: "Congratulations on all of your hard work.  This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world. And believe me, this is only the beginning!  Fire the weapon."
Kuvira says: "What's wrong?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Probably something minor.  I should be able to find the problem.  The distributor pin is gone.  I swear I locked it in place yesterday. There's no way it could have just fallen out."
Kuvira says: "And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?"
Baatar Jr. says: "It could cause it to explode."
Kuvira says: "What do you know about this?"
Zhu Li says: "Nothing."
Kuvira says: "You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness.  This is how you repay me?!"
Zhu Li says: "You're a monster. I regret nothing."
Kuvira says: "Chain her up in the target town. She can see how the weapon works  up close and personal."
Opal says: "Oh, no."
