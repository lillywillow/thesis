Song says: "You've got a visitor."
Bolin says: "Hey, Mako."
Mako says: "Hey. What's with the fancy duds?"
Bolin says: "I'm on my way to the big finale for "Nuktuk: Hero of the South."  Yeah, everyone's gonna be there except for, you know, you ... because you're in jail and stuff."
Mako says: "Thanks for the reminder."
Bolin says: "Hey, I brought you something. I thought this would brighten up your new place. Read the inscription."
Mako says: ""Dear Mako, Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling.'"  Did you come by just to give me a poster?"
Bolin says: "No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement. I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you.  We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal."
Mako says: "I am not a criminal!"
Bolin says: "Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one, cause you're in a jail and that's where criminals live."
Mako says: "I was set up! Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested."
Bolin says: "Ah, I see what you're doing. You're going for the insanity defense. Smart."
Mako says: "No! I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me."
Bolin says: "I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her. You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad.  Okay, gotta run,  but I'll be back tomorrow. And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy."
Mako says: "Bolin, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled."
Bolin says: "Yeah, okay, big brother. I promise.  Whew! That insanity defense is definitely gonna work."
