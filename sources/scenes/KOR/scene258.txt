Korra says: "If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?"
Zaheer says: "He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards."
Korra says: "So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me."
Zaheer says: "Yes. He allowed me and my friends to remain in prison while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission."
Korra says: "And what is your mission, exactly?"
Zaheer says: "I want what you want: to restore balance to this world."
Korra says: "I don't think our ideas of balance are the same."
Zaheer says: "Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open. But why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning."
Korra says: "What do you mean?"
Zaheer says: "The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic president and a tyrannical queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?"
Korra says: "No. I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer."
Zaheer says: "It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out, thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for world dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down."
Korra says: "But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos."
Zaheer says: "Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, "New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old"?"
Korra says: "No."
Zaheer says: "The wise Guru Laghima. An airbender."
