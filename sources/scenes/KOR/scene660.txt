Warehouse worker says: "Psst.  Over here.  Listen, I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. I thought he could make life better for us nonbenders. But I didn't sign up for this ...  this war."
Lin says: "What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?"
Warehouse worker says: "He manufactured those gloves  for the Equalists."
Korra says: "I knew it!"
Warehouse worker says: "And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon."
Tenzin says: "We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing."
Warehouse worker says: "That's because he has a secret factory."
Korra says: "Where?"
Warehouse worker says: "It's right underneath the Sato Mansion."
Tenzin says: "Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong ..."
Lin says: "I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon."
