Asami says: "Where's Varrick? We should've closed our deal an hour ago."
Bolin says: "Would you relax? This place is great.  And the best part about it,  Eska doesn't know I'm here."
Bolin says: "Ee-yah.  I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey."
Eska says: "I'm not on the hunt for you.  Currently."
Desna says: "We search for Varrick. Our father wishes him to stand trial."
Asami says: "What did he do?"
Eska says: "He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle."
Asami says: "What?"
Mako says: "Korra's parents were arrested?"
Desna says: "Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive."
Bolin says: "Yeah, he's a cop."
Northern guardsman says: "Varrick's not here."
Eska says: "Very well. Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere.  Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit."
Bolin says: "Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter."
Eska says: "You are so cute when you grovel."
Asami says: "Don't let her treat you that way. Stand up for yourself."
Bolin says: "I tried to break up with her, but Mako gave me terrible advice. Thank you, Mako."
Mako says: "Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?"
Asami says: "Bolin, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel."
Varrick says: "Honesty is for fools, kid."
Bolin says: "Varrick?"
Varrick says: "If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. Disappear, like I did."
Asami says: "Where are you?"
Varrick says: "Somewhere Unalaq will never find me.  Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?"
Mako says: "The coast is clear. You can come out."
Varrick says: "No way, mister. Not until I know it's absolutely 157% safe.  Ah! Thank you, Zhu Li."
Asami says: "Your assistant's in there too?"
Varrick says: "Zhu Li never leaves my side.  Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey!"
Zhu Li says: "Sorry, sir. There isn't any in here."
Varrick says: "No honey? We're in a bear for crying out loud!"
Mako says: "I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing."
Varrick says: "Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back."
Bolin says: "Wow!"
Varrick says: "Now listen up. Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison."
Bolin says: "What's the money for?"
Varrick says: "Bribery, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans."
Bolin says: "I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear."
