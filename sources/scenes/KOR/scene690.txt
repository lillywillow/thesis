Tenzin says: "I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me. If anything happens to her I won't be able to forgive myself."
Kya says: "She's very smart, and she obviously has a strong connection to the spirits. She'll be fine."
Bumi says: "Yeah, Dad went all the time!"
Tenzin says: "They won't have their bending in there. They'll be defenseless!"
Bumi says: "Ahem? Excuse me? But I've never had bending, and I don't think I'd call myself defenseless."
Tenzin says: "Of course you aren't, because you have your ...  um ..."
Kya says: "Positive attitude?"
Bumi says: "I would've said acute intellect and cat-like reflexes, but whatever."
Tenzin says: "Why don't you two get some sleep. I'll take the first watch."
Kya says: "Wake us up if you need some company."
Bumi says: "Or if any interesting spirit-y stuff happens, like their bodies start floating around and you need someone to help you grab them before they fly off!"
Kya says: "Bumi!"
Bumi says: "I'm just saying, we're here if you need us."
Tenzin says: "I know you are. Thank you.  Please come back soon."
