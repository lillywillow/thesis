Mako says: "I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now.  Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?"
Asami says: "What do you mean?"
Mako says: "That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years."
Korra says: "I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming."
Varrick says: "Maybe a little too overwhelming?"
Bolin says: "Hey, Varrick. What are you doing here?"
Varrick says: "Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, feet."
Mako says: "What were you saying about the evidence?"
Varrick says: "I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof."
Mako says: "Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?"
Varrick says: "Yes, just like that! Remember how great that worked? Well, not for you."
Mako says: "You're right. All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback."
Bolin says: "But for who?"
Mako says: "For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei."
