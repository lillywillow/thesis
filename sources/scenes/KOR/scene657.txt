Mako says: "What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?"
Korra says: "I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists."
Asami says: "What? I don't believe this."
Mako says: "You spied on Hiroshi?  What's your problem?"
Lin says: "Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you."
Asami says: "My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists."
Hiroshi Sato says: "Equalists?  Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals."
Mako says: "Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra."
Korra says: "I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that!"
Hiroshi Sato says: "This is all just a misunderstanding, resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles.  It's just business. Nothing nefarious."
Tenzin says: "In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?"
Hiroshi Sato says: "If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries."
