Katara says: "Aang's time has passed.  My brother and many of my friends are gone.  It's time for you and your generation to take over the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world.  And I think you're going to be a great Avatar."
Korra says: "Thank you."
Katara says: "Goodbye, Korra."
