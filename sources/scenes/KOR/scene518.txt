Korra says: "I want to face Zaheer."
Tenzin says: "Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted."
Korra says: "I need to if I wanna save Jinora and the others. There's no other way."
Tenzin says: "There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal."
Korra says: "You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you?  No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore."
Tenzin says: "It's not that at all."
Korra says: "I know I can do this."
Tenzin says: "I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you, too."
Korra says: "Tenzin, please. I'll be okay."
Tenzin says: "Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance."
Korra says: "Thank you."
