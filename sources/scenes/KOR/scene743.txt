Tenzin says: "Nothing like a ten-mile hike first thing in the morning."
Yung says: "Don't these robes come in a warm bison fur version?"
Tenzin says: "No! Of course not."
Bumi says: "If it weren't so cold, I'd go right back to sleep."
Tenzin says: "Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing.  Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping."
Bumi says: "You know when I said that thing about an iron fist-"
Tenzin says: "Hush! Meditation time. Focus."
Bumi says: "Can we go back to bed now?"
Tenzin says: "Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise.  The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection.  Now you try.  Back up your posts! It's not hard if you concentrate.  Get back up!  What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier?"
Jinora says: "Don't you think you're a little hard on them."
Tenzin says: "Don't worry, they can take it. You'll see.  Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears. Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there!  When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him. It is both humbling and freeing."
Kai says: "Hey, you want to go sneak away and check on the baby bisons?"
Jinora says: "Shhh. You should be paying attention."
