Gun says: "Your Majesty. The Avatar has returned with the tax payments."
Hou-Ting says: "Finally. Secure it in the vault."
Gun says: "It's being done as we speak."
Korra says: "So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city."
Hou-Ting says: "The Dai Li thoroughly searched the city, but it seems your reports were incorrect. There are no airbenders in Ba Sing Se. So, you can gather your little band and be on your way tomorrow."
Korra says: "You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!"
Hou-Ting says: "Get her out of my sight!"
Korra says: "This isn't over! I'm going to find the airbenders!"
