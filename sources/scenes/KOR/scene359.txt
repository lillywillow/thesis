Guard #1 says: "How many push-ups did you do last night? 'Cause I did like fifty."
Lin says: "What do you two think you're doing?! Get back to work!"
Aiwei says: "Is everything all right here?"
Lin says: "The Avatar is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chit-chatting."
Aiwei says: "Don't worry, Zaofu is the most secure city in the world."
Lin says: "I'll be the judge of that. I'm going to check every inch of this place."
Aiwei says: "Lin, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax."
Lin says: "I'm fine!"
Aiwei says: "It doesn't take a truth seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your suppressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health ... and your job."
Lin says: "I'm not interested in talking about my feelings."
Aiwei says: "You won't have to say a word. I know a great acupuncturist in town who will be able to help you."
Lin says: "Hmm."
