Bolin says: "Hang on, I think I got it. Let me just try this.  Nope, okay maybe-"
Wei says: "Trial by fire. It's the best way to learn metalbending.  Agh!"
Mako says: "Whoa. Nice shot, Bolin! Â But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending."
Wei says: "Yeah, cheater."
Bolin says: "Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal!"
Korra says: "Woo-hoo!  Metalbending champion!"
Bolin says: "Oh sure. She's the Avatar."
Asami says: "Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner."
Bolin says: "Oh, now I have to say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever!"
