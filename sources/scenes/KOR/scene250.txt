Tavern owner says: "Shoo! Human customers only."
Mako says: "Let's see if this guy knows anything.  Excuse me, sir? We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe."
Bolin says: "And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose  to his  ear. Freaks me out."
Tavern owner says: "Yeah, sure. Sounds like a guy who came in last night. I told him I had the best drinks in the Earth Kingdom and he called me a liar."
Mako says: "That's him! Any idea where he is now?"
Tavern owner says: "Nah, afraid not. But he was right.  My drinks are terrible."
