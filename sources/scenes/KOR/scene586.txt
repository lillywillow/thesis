Toph says: "Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax."
Korra says: "I am relaxed."
Toph says: "Seriously? Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!"
Korra says: "Just do it! I'm ready."
Toph says: "It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!"
Korra says: "I'm not fighting!"
Toph says: "All right, that's it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there."
Korra says: "What do you mean? Why would I want poison inside me?"
Toph says: "I don't know! Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar. If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!"
Korra says: "Whaâ€’ That's ridiculous!"
Toph says: "Whatever. When you want it out, you can bend it out. I can't deal with all your issues for you."
Korra says: "Wait! What am I supposed to do now?"
Toph says: "How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here. The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!"
Tenzin says: "This ... is a mission of the utmost importance. Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we need to find the Avatar.  Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?"
Meelo says: "You can count on one of us. I don't know about these two ladies."
