Gun says: "Avatar Korra, Master Tenzin, it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun."
Korra says: "Thank you."
Bolin says: "Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell."
Gun says: "Oh no, the queen hates animals.  You'll have to get them out of sight."
Bolin says: "Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt,  these two are going to be a little tougher."
Gun says: "Come with me, hurry, I'll take you to your quarters."
