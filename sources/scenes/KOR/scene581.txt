Gun says: "Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!"
Spectator #1 says: "Go Wu! Woohoo ..."
Spectator #2 says: "Woohoo ..."
Wu says: "Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention.  Kuvira, rise!  For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings."
Kuvira says: "Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words."
Wu says: "Why not?  We've got six hours to fill ..."
Kuvira says: "Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong,  I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.  I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out,  this man has no authority."
Wu says: "Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!"
Kuvira says: "I have created a new Earth Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people."
Crowd says: "We love you, Kuvira!  All hail the Great Uniter!"
Kuvira says: "And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing:  Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be crushed."
Crowd says: "Thank you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!"
Wu says: "Worst coronation ever."
