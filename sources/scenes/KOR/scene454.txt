Raiko says: "How did this Cultural Center attack happen right under your nose? And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?"
Lin says: "We're working on it, sir."
Raiko says: "Well, work harder! If you don't get any results soon, I'm going to find someone who can."
Mako says: "I got a break in the bombing case. I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene."
Lu says: "That's great, Mako."
Gang says: "Yeah, you better run that in to Beifong right now."
Mako says: "You think?"
Lu says: "Sure. You're gonna be a hero!"
Lin says: "What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the President?"
Mako says: "I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing."
Lin says: "Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron.  Now get out!"
Lu says: "Sorry. Was she busy?"
Mako says: "This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the Agni Kais. Someone must have hired him to make it look like Northerners attacked the Cultural Center."
Gang says: "Hmm."
Mako says: "Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible."
Lu says: "Listen, kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay?"
Gang says: "Yeah, give it a rest, Super Cop."
Raiko says: "I've heard good things about you. You've made some big triad busts for a rookie."
Mako says: "Thank you, sir."
Raiko says: "And you're dating the Avatar, right?"
Mako says: "Yes, sir."
Raiko says: "I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick. You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City, would you, officer?  Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else."
Mako says: "Yes, sir."
Raiko says: "Well, keep up the good work."
Mako says: "Wait, there's something you should know."
