Tonraq says: "I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra."
Tonraq says: "We tracked them deep into an ancient forest. Many believed this forest was the home to spirits, and the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack them on such hallow grounds. They thought wrong."
Tonraq says: "We captured the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest.  I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done.  By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits."
Tonraq says: "They threatened to destroy everything, the entire city."
Tonraq says: "Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done.  For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame."
