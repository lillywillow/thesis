Kai says: "They're so friendly now."
Tenzin says: "The bison are the original airbenders. They recognize their own kind."
Jinora says: "I'm sorry for running off."
Tenzin says: "I'm just lucky no one's hurt."
Jinora says: "I know."
Tenzin says: "But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you."
Jinora says: "Does that mean I can get my airbender tattoos?"
Tenzin says: "It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos. I'll promise I'll think about it. Fair enough?"
Jinora says: "Yeah."
Kai says: "Jinora, look. They're flying!"
Tenzin says: "I guess everyone is growing up."

Tenzin says: "Earth.  Fire.  Air.  Water.  When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.  Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko  transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations,  a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony.  They named the capital of this great land, Republic City.  Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.  But sadly, his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew."
