Tenzin says: "No, no, you can't just demonstrate it. That never works."
Meelo says: "Good!"
Tenzin says: "Ugh, classic over-rewarding."
Meelo says: "Poki, where are you going?"
Tenzin says: "Command respect.  Having some trouble, son?"
Meelo says: "Poki isn't very good at learning."
Tenzin says: "Believe me, I know the feeling. Maybe I can help. How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?"
Meelo says: "Yeah!"
