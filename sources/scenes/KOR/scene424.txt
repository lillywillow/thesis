Asami says: "Hi."
Mako says: "Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?"
Asami says: "No. I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay. You seemed so agitated earlier."
Mako says: "I'm fine."
Asami says: "Maybe you need a night off. Why don't we go get some dinner?"
Mako says: "No, thanks. I'm a little busy."
Asami says: "Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine?  Remember? We had our first date there."
Mako says: "Maybe I do need to get my mind off things."
Lu says: "Police!  Hey, Mako.  Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds."
Mako says: "What's going on?"
Lu says: "We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job."
Mako says: "All right.  It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back."
Lin says: "According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property."
Asami says: "That's crazy!"
Mako says: "You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?"
Lin says: "I have to follow up on a lead."
Lu says: "Well, looky what I found: cash ...  And these."
Lin says: "What are you doing with explosives, Mako?"
Mako says: "I don't know where those came from."
Gang says: "You're under arrest."
Mako says: "None of that is mine."
Gang says: "Yeah. Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals. Once a Triple Threat, always a Triple Threat."
Asami says: "This has to be a mistake."
Lu says: "Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse."
Gang says: "He was using you the whole time."
Mako says: "That's not true, Asami. I would never do anything to hurt you.  It's Varrick. This is all Varrick. He set me up!"
Gang says: "Yeah, it's Varrick's fault. Varrick.  Varrick."
