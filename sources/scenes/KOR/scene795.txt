Varrick says: "Guys, hey,  what do you think? Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.  Zhu Li, c'mon, we got guests!  Whip up a pot of that green tea I love!"
Zhu Li says: "Yes, sir."
Korra says: "Zhu Li's in prison with you?"
Varrick says: "Of course! I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?"
Mako says: "We're not interested in your tea. And this isn't a friendly visit."
Varrick says: "Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things, too.  Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?  I did.  Bolin, who got you into the movers?  I did.  Asami, who saved your company?  I did.  Mako, who got you thrown in jail!?  I did!  Oh yeah, guess that was a bad thing."
Asami says: "You stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president. Those are pretty bad, too."
Varrick says: "I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. Well, a bigger war."
Bolin says: "Well we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?"
Varrick says: "The Future Industries' stuff? It's on my battleship."
Korra says: "You have a battleship?"
Varrick says: "Of course I do! I bought the first one they made! Named her the "Zhu Li"."
Bolin says: "You named your battleship after your assistant?"
Varrick says: "Yup. They're both cold, heartless war machines."
Zhu Li says: "Your tea, sir."
Varrick says: "Look, I'm truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you,  take Zhu Li.  My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
Korra says: "It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
Bolin says: "All right! Team Avatar is back in business. Haha!"
Mako says: "It's okay. We're going to stop Unalaq, and get Jinora back."
Korra says: "I hope my dad's all right."
Mako says: "I'm sure he's fine."
