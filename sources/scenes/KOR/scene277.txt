Mako says: "Asami, I think I know who set us up."
Varrick says: "Hello, Mako."
Mako says: "What are you doing here?"
Asami says: "He just saved my company.  Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?"
Varrick says: "Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy."
Asami says: "So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?"
Mako says: "Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it.  I'll fill you in later."
