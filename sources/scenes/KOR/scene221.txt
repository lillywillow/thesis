Shiro Shinobi says: "Love is in the air! Since Avatar Korra has arrived in Republic City she's only had eyes for one fellow: Mako. The feeling seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened. Now Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of the beautiful Asami. Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?"
Mako says: "It's been great having you at so many back-to-back practices, Korra."
Korra says: "Feels good to be back, although  Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence."
Bolin says: "Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets before you joined his task force."
Mako says: "Okay, come on, team huddle time!"
Mako says: "It's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the Fire Ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?"
Korra and Bolin says: "We're ready!"
Asami says: "Not quite, you'll need these."
Mako says: "Hey, Asami."
Asami says: "Good morning, sweetie."
Mako says: "These new uniforms look great!"
Asami says: "You look great, champ!"
Mako says: "Well, teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date."
Bolin says: "Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see ya."
Bolin says: "So, Korra. There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone."
Korra says: "Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!"
