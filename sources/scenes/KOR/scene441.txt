Lin says: "Welcome home, Avatar.  Thanks for starting a war."
Korra says: "I didn't start a war. Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem."
Lin says: "Mako, I want you back on the beat. There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand."
Mako says: "I'm all yours."
Korra says: "I'll go too. The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders."
Lin says: "Great, that should calm them down."
Mako says: "Maybe you should sit this out."
Korra says: "What?"
Mako says: "I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse. You could at least try to seem neutral."
Korra says: "I'm not neutral! The North invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South."
Varrick says: "Zhu Li's already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get them on board."
Mako says: "Whatever, I gotta go to work."
Asami says: "I better go check on my factory."
Korra says: "I'm going to find out about this peace march."
Varrick says: "And I am dying for a pedicure."
Bolin says: "So, um, what should I be doing?"
Mako says: "I don't know, Bolin. Figure something out."
Varrick says: "Say, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night?"
Bolin says: "Sure, I live here."
Varrick says: "Have you really seen it?"
Bolin says: "Y- no?"
Varrick says: "That's what I thought. Come on."
