Tenzin says: "So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?"
Lin says: "That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?"
Korra says: "Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something."
Lin says: "He does have the means ... and he has a motive."
Tenzin says: "That's right."
Korra says: "A motive? What is it?"
Tenzin says: "Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in."
Korra says: "That's terrible."
Tenzin says: "It was tragic. It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time."
Lin says: "Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely."
