Mako says: "So, how was the big premiere?"
Bolin says: "I saved the president, in real life!"
Mako says: "Wait, wh-what?"
Bolin says: "You were right about Varrick. He tried to kidnap Raiko!"
Mako says: "I knew it!"
Bolin says: "But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. Beifong says you're free to go.  Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
Mako says: "Don't worry about it bro."
Lin Beifong says: "Nice job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective."
Gang says: "But chief, there aren't any detective openings right now."
Lin Beifong says: "Actually we have two openings."
Korra says: "Mako, I've missed you so much."
Bolin says: "Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back."
Mako says: "Korra ... hey, I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me?"
Korra says: "Why would I be mad?"
Mako says: "We had that fight before you left, remember?"
Korra says: "No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?"
Mako says: "Uh ...  No. No, it wasn't that bad."
Tenzin says: "Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq."
Bolin says: "I think I know just the man to talk to."
