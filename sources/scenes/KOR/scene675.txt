Unalaq says: "Congratulations, everyone.  You've all got front row seats for the beginning of a new world order."
Korra says: "You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years."
Unalaq says: "You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds,  but there shouldn't be a bridge: we should live together as one."
Korra says: "Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did."
Unalaq says: "It's true that when Wan fused with Raava he tipped the scales in her favor, but this time I'll be here to level the playing field. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu, and together we will become the new Avatar:  a Dark Avatar. Your era is over."
Tonraq says: "Think about what you're doing. I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother, you're Eska and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?"
Unalaq says: "I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. Vaatu and I will be as one. No one will be able to stand against us.  Keep them locked up. After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra."
Eska says: "Yes, Father."
