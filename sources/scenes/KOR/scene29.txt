Tenzin says: "No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time!  Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs."
Korra says: "Great, more attention."
Bumi says: "Hah! Relax ... I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin"."
Tenzin says: "You're not invited."
Korra says: "Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks."
Tenzin's children says: "Yay!"
Bumi says: "Yep. There's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me."
Mako says: "So I walk up and say: "Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here.""
Korra says: "Did you write that beforehand?"
Mako says: "Yeah! I had a few others.  Let's see, uh ... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad", huh? Or, "when you get to jail,  tell 'em Mako sent ya"."
Korra says: "Ooh, I like that one."
Mako says: "Okay, I'll use that next time. Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon."
Korra says: "That sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon."
Mako says: "Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be."
Korra says: "Of course you'd take his side!"
Mako says: "I'm not taking his side, I'm just ..."
Korra says: "I'm gonna take a walk."
Mako says: "Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?"
