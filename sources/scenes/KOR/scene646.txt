Chow says: "You know, San would've been so proud of you guys! Traveling the world with the Avatar? He would've loved that!"
Mako says: "We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring. We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se."
Bolin says: "What? What happened?"
Chow says: "One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up. No one's seen him since."
Tu says: "They say the Earth Queen's locking all the airbenders up somewhere, and using them for experiments."
Yin says: "Tu! Don't talk like that about Her Majesty!  Long may she reign."
Mako says: "We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra."
Bolin says: "I hope Kai is okay."
