Lin says: "How many of those things are you going to stick in me?"
Guo says: "I'll be placing several needles on each of your acu-points. There's nothing to be scared about."
Lin says: "I'm not afraid of needles!"
Guo says: "Please, close your eyes and take a deep breath.  This process corrects an imbalance in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure."
Lin says: "I can't feel a thing."
Guo says: "That's unusual. Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles.  Acupuncture often taps into peoples' buried memories. These memories can sometimes be difficult to process."
Lin says: "Huh, buried memories. Uh-huh."
