Bumi says: "Uh ... Hey there, Dad. You're looking well.  Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped. But I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud."
Kya says: "Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi."
Bumi says: "Kya! I-I was just,  uh ... cleaning off Dad's statue.  It's so dusty in here."
Kya says: "Come here."
Bumi says: "Thanks, Kya. You always know when I need a hug."
