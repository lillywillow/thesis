Radio operator says: "Hey! You can't be in here!"
Zaheer says: "No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?"
Radio operator says: "Who do you think you are?"
Ming-Hua says: "He's the man who just took down the Earth Queen. You want to be next?!"
Zaheer says: "Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them.  Now, can you help me?"
Zaheer says: "Attention citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make.  Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down by the hands of revolutionaries,  including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, because my identity is not important.  I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants. From now on, you are free!  I deliver Ba Sing Se be into the hands of the people!"
Mako says: "We have to get out of here, Bolin. Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next."
Prisoner says: "You know that guy? He's my hero!"
Mako says: "Shut up!  You have to metalbend us out of here. C'mon! I know you can do it! This is your time!"
Bolin says: "You said before "was my time"."
Mako says: "I know I did it, but now it's really your time.  Do it!"
Bolin says: "Did you see that? I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!"
Mako says: "I don't think that was you."
Zaheer says: "Listen to me. I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first. I have a message that I need you to take to Korra."
