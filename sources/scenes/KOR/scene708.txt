Bolin says: "So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?"
Ahnah says: "Call it what it is: a prison."
Baraz says: "Kuvira's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up."
Bolin says: "Purging?!"
Baraz says: "What are you acting so surprised for? You must have known what she was up to, being part of her "inner circle" and all."
Bolin says: "No, I swear! And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!"
Varrick says: "Will you at least tell us where you're taking us?"
Baraz says: "The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some Earth Empire soldiers."
Ahnah says: "And once we're through, we'll see about letting you go."
Varrick says: "Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!"
Bolin says: "Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore."
Varrick says: "Yeah. If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!"
Baraz says: "If you really are fugitives, you better listen up. We've been scouting this region for days. There's a wall stretching along the entire border and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is the only way out."
Ahnah says: "It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?"
Baraz says: "If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the Earth Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other."
Bolin says: "All right, where is this checkpoint?"
