Bolin says: "Mako! Do you know who that is? It's Toza, legendary earthbending captain of the Boar-q-pines. He's my hero. What do you think he's doing here?"
Mako says: "If you'd stop talking, we could hear."
Shady Shin says: "Here's your 10,000 yuans.  Not bad, considering all you have to do is lose your match tonight.  Hey, you're welcome!"
Shady Shin says: "Can you believe that ingrate mook?"
Bolin says: "Wow. I mean, I hate to see Toza lose, even if he needs to."
Mako says: "Why? He got paid. You didn't see any pro-benders crying for us when mom and dad died, and we got dumped on the street. Life is hard. You either hustle or get hustled."
Shady Shin says: "And speaking of hustling, you two need to hit the bricks and collect enough bets to make this little investment pay off. 'Cause if you don't, you're gonna be right back in the dumpster where I found ya."
Mako says: "Don't worry, bro. We'll do fine."
Shady Shin says: "Seeing those young crooks really gives me hope for the future."
