Mako says: "So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?"
Korra says: "I learned how to connect to people's energies through them."
Asami says: "Who taught you that?"
Korra says: "Lin's mom.  I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild."
Asami says: "You met Toph? What was she like?"
Korra says: "A cranky, more miserable version of Lin."
Mako says: "Is that even possible?"
Korra says: "You'd be surprised."
Mako says: "Which train is Wu on?"
Korra says: "I don't know!"
Mako says: "Split up and start looking."
