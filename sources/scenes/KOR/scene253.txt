Mako says: "Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please."
Innkeeper says: "Forget it! Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room."
Macao says: "We found you!"
Innkeeper says: "Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside!"
Macao says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not here to fight you.  We're here to meet Nuktuk!"
Lily says: "We're your biggest fans. Can you make it out to Lily and Macao?"
Bolin says: "Uh, I'd be happy to. Always love meeting my fans."
Lily says: "I made this Nuktuk doll for you."
Bolin says: "Uh, it's ... cute."
Innkeeper says: "Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn."
Mako says: "We'll just take the one across from 102."
Innkeeper says: "But that room is too small for the four of you!"
Mako says: "Trust me, it'll be perfect."
