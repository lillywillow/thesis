Shiro Shinobi says: "The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the championship match.  Will the Wolfbats' ferocity help them repeat as champs?  Or will the underdog Fire Ferrets serve up a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?"
Bolin says: "Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous. You're gonna do great, I believe in you."
Ring announcer says: "Introducing the challengers, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!"
Bolin says: "You're on, Pabu."
Bolin says: "Yes! Nailed it!  He's so talented!"
Ring announcer says: "And their opponents, the three timed defending champions, the White Falls Wolfbats!"
Bolin says: "Pfft,  they got nothing on us, buddy. Anybody can howl.  Hm, whatever."
Korra says: "I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair off his stupid head!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "The champs and challengers face off at the center-line and here we go!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water boxing.  Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor.  Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'"
Mako says: "Nice shot!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched.  Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that would certainly elicit a foul.  Or apparently not."
Mako says: "What's the big idea, ref? That was a hosing foul!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "And the Wolfbats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit.  A questionable call by the officials.  Ming trips up Mako with another dirty trick!"
