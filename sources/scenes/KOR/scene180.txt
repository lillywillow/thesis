Zhu Li says: "Do you think this plan will actually work, sir?"
Varrick says: "I know I can stop the mecha suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse.  Zhu Li, I've been thinking."
Zhu Li says: "You're always thinking, sir."
Varrick says: "Yes. But lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess and I feel like there are some things I should tell you."
Zhu Li says: "There are?"
Varrick says: "I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks.  I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted."
Zhu Li says: "You'll have to finish your story later. Kuvira's troops are in range.  Okay, I hope this works."
Varrick says: "Yes! Dead in their tracks.  Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!"
Zhu Li says: "I'm afraid there are no more things to do."
Kuvira says: "What was that?"
Soldier says: "An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine."
Kuvira says: "Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city."
