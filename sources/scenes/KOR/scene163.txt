Tonraq says: "Did you speak to Zaheer?"
Korra says: "Yes. He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple."
Suyin says: "I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece."
Lin says: "How?"
Suyin says: "Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage. I say we split into two teams:  Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple.  Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak."
Zaheer says: "Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind. Empty and become wind."
P'Li says: "The airbenders are secured."
Zaheer says: "Thank you, P'Li. For everything."
P'Li says: "Of course."
Zaheer says: "I want you to know:  not one day went by in that prison when I didn't think of you."
P'Li says: "The years apart only made my love for you stronger. And deep down I knew you would find a way to get me out. Just like you saved me from becoming that warlord's killing machine when I was a girl.  You've shown me what true freedom means."
Zaheer says: "And after today,  we'll show the entire world what it means. No more prisons, no more running."
P'Li says: "I love you, Zaheer."
Zaheer says: "I love you too."
