Korra says: "There's Amon."
Mako says: "We need to get into the temple. Then, when he returns ..."
Korra says: "We ambush him."
Lieutenant says: "What are you two doing here?"
Mako says: "Uh, we were just transferred."
Lieutenant says: "Well, you're getting transferred again. Amon wants extra security at the arena today."
Mako says: "The arena? For what?"
Lieutenant says: "The rally. You should've been briefed about this."
Korra says: "We'll be there, sir.  I know another way in."
