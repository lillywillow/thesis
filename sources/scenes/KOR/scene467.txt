Tarrlok says: "Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists."
Female reporter says: "Question for the Avatar!  Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?"
Korra says: "You want to know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward.  Amon, I challenge you to a duel! No task force, no chi blockers, just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, if you're man enough to face me."
