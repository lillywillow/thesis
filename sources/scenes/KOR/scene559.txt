Jinora says: "Ooh, he's cute.  Korra, is that the  handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?"
Ikki says: "Does he drive you crazy in a bad way,  or does he drive you crazy like you like him?"
Korra says: "Ahem. Oh. Hey, Mako."
Mako says: "You seen Bolin?"
Korra says: "Nice to see you, too.  And no.  I haven't seen him since practice. Think something's wrong?"
Mako says: "I don't know.  Bolin has a knack for getting into stupid situations.  See you later."
Korra says: "Wait.  I could, uh ... help you look for him."
Mako says: "Nah. I got it."
Korra says: "Hey, cool guy, let me help you.  We can take Naga."
Mako says: "Who's Naga?"
Korra says: "My best friend. And a great tracker."
