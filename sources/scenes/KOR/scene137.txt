Korra says: "Spirits, this is the Avatar.  Please listen to me.  Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for. I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.  It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans."
Dragon eel spirit says: "We don't  get involved with human wars."
Korra says: "Spirits worked with Unalaq."
Dragon eel spirit says: "He was misusing Vaatu's power during Harmonic Convergence to force spirits to fight you. Is that what you want?"
Korra says: "No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share."
Dragon eel spirit says: "What you want is exactly what Kuvira wants: to use spirits as a weapon in a human war.  The answer is no."
Korra says: "Wait! Please, listen.  If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other!"
