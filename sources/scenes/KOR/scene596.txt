Hotah says: "What do you want?"
Korra says: "It's not about what I want. It's about what Naga wants.  And she'd like you to let my father out of prison."
Hotah says: "I-I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders."
Korra says: "What are you talking about?"
Hotah says: "I-I've said too much."
Korra says: "Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking."
Hotah says: "I-I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair."
Korra says: "So Unalaq told you what to say?"
Hotah says: "Yes! Every word."
Korra says: "Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?"
Hotah says: "He's trying to keep you on his side. But he also wants your father out of the way. Just like when he got your father banished."
Korra says: "What do you mean, "he got my father banished"?"
Hotah says: "Nothing!"
Korra says: "Keep talking."
