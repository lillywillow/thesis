Jinora says: "Hey, has anyone seen Kai?"
Tenzin says: "Kai?"
Bolin says: "Kai, little bro."
Bumi says: "He's not over here."
Asami says: "I don't think I've seen him since we landed."
Mako says: "I knew that kid was no good. He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again."
Jinora says: "We have to find him."
Mako says: "What's the point? He obviously doesn't care about us."
Bolin says: "But he's my new little brother. He's probably lost, and scared."
Tenzin says: "He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility. Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him."
Mako says: "Fine. Bolin and I will find him."
