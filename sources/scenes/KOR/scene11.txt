Zaheer says: "Looks like he's in hurry. Wait here."
Dai Li agent says: "Your Majesty, we received a distress signal from the airship carrying the prisoners. We believed the ship crashed in the Si Wong desert and the Avatar may have escaped."
Hou-Ting says: "This is outrageous! Send another airship to retrieve the Avatar immediately."
Dai Li agent says: "It's already on its way, Your Majesty."
Ming-Hua says: "What are we going to do now?"
Ghazan says: "There's no way we can track her down in the desert before the queen gets to her."
P'Li says: "You really think we'd be lucky enough to capture her again? She'll be long gone by the time they arrive."
Zaheer says: "It doesn't matter. We're through chasing her. It's time to make her come to us."
Hou-Ting says: "What is this riff-raff doing in my throne room unannounced?"
Zaheer says: "Apologies, Your Majesty. But I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today."
Hou-Ting says: "The Avatar is still in my custody. However, eavesdropping on royal conversations will land you in a cell right next to those boys you brought in. Now, if you value your freedom, you'll tell me where the airbenders are right now!"
Zaheer says: "That wasn't the deal."
Hou-Ting says: "I will not bandy words with bounty hunters!  Seize these hoodlums and throw them in prison until they decide to show proper respect for the crown!"
Hou-Ting says: "Gun! Get in back here and lay down your life for your queen, you coward!  You wouldn't dare attack a queen!"
Zaheer says: "Maybe I forgot to mention something to you. I don't believe in queens.  You think freedom is something that you can give or take on a whim ...  To your people ... freedom is just as essential as ... air. And without it ... there is no life.  There is only ... darkness."
