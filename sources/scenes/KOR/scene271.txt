Assistant director says: "And action!"
Ginger says: "Forget about me. You must capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away."
Nuktuk says: "No! I'll never leave you."
Varrick says: "Cut!  There's no kiss in the script."
Bolin says: "Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment.  It just felts so right."
Ginger says: "Urch."
Varrick says: "It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work. Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers. I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve."
Bolin says: "So ... that kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too."
Ginger says: "Uch. You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character."
Bolin says: "Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not."
Ginger says: "That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin."
Bolin says: "But Nuktuk is Bolin. I'm a hero."
