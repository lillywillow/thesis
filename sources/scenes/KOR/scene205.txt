Bolin says: "That's everyone, our half of the train is clear."
Varrick says: "That's good, we're almost out of time."
Baatar Jr. says: "You're insane."
Varrick says: "You knew that when you hired me! Bolin, do the thing!  Unhook the cars, oh, come on, that was an easy one!"
Bolin says: "Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up! Now, how do we turn this thing off?"
Varrick says: "Ooh, we can't turn it off. We're gonna blow up--  --but, we had a pretty good run, right?"
Bolin says: "What are you talking about, "a good run"? I'm still running! I like running!"
Varrick says: "I'll see you on the other side,  Zhu Li."
Bolin says: "I want you to know,  I hate you."
Baatar Jr. says: "I can't believe he actually blew himself up. That man was crazier than a sewer pipe elephant-rat.  Let's get back to Zaofu."
