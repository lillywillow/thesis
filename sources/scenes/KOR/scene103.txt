Raiko says: "The Earth Kingdom is in chaos. There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation."
Suyin says: "And you think I should be the one?"
Tenzin says: "You're the perfect person to take charge. The world leaders trust you, and, as a Beifong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom."
Suyin says: "I'm honored that you thought of me, but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation.  I'm afraid I can't help you."
Kuvira says: "Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone."
Suyin says: "What would you have me do? March into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war."
Kuvira says: "There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things."
Suyin says: "It's not going to happen."
