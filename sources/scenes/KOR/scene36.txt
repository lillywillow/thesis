Korra says: "This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle."
Unalaq says: "This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky."
Korra says: "Wow, I've never seen that."
Unalaq says: "And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you. To help you fulfill your destiny."
Tonraq says: "I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her."
Unalaq says: "Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole."
Korra says: "I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?"
Tonraq says: "We all did what we thought was best for you."
Korra says: "Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's."
