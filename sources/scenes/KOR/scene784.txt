Rebel leader says: "Should we wait another day? Korra still might come with reinforcements."
Tonraq says: "We can't wait any longer.  It's time to take back what is ours! It's time to take back our city!"

Photographer says: "Say "Nuktuk"!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "There they are folks. The sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple, Bolin and Ginger."
Bolin says: "Wow, that was fun! And did you hear what Shiro said? We're Republic City's most famous couple."
Ginger says: "Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are not a couple."
Bolin says: "That's not what Shiro said!"
Lin Beifong says: "Stop stuffing your mustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!"
Gang says: "You got it, boss."
Lin Beifong says: "You two are the pinnacle of refinement."
Shiro Shinobi says: "This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier folks. President Raiko and the First Lady Buttercup Raiko just arrived,  and they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire Varrick."
Varrick says: "There they are, my two most honored guests.  What do you think?  No expense has been spared, I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se, and the best food from around the world. Heck! I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation! They make the best red stuff over there. Fact! All right, picture time."
Raiko says: "Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
Varrick says: "I wanted to. Mister President, I took one look at your wife and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.  And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!"
Raiko says: "Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe."
Varrick says: "Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be."
