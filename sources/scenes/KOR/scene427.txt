Unalaq says: "The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal. I have failed you, Vaatu."
Vaatu says: "You have not failed me ... yet. The Avatar still lives."
Unalaq says: "How do you know?"
Vaatu says: "Even though my connection to Raava was severed, I can still feel her presence."
Unalaq says: "I'll find her."
Vaatu says: "The Avatar will find you.  She has just entered the Spirit World."
