Shung says: "Master Tenzin, welcome!"
Tenzin says: "Good to see you again, Abbot Shung."
Shung says: "Is there anything you need? Water? Dandelion greens? Ahh, perhaps you'd like to recenter yourself by meditating in the gardens?"
Tenzin says: "No thank you, I'm fine."
Shung says: "And you must be the honorable Pema! Please, accept these gifts.  This is an ancient airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you."
Tenzin says: "Oh.  Okay?"
Shung says: "And Pema!  These flowers once filled the mountainside! Now, they can brighten up your room."
Pema says: "That's ... sweet? Y-you didn't have to."
Shung says: "Nonsense! Whatever you need is yours. Anything for the mother of the next generation of airbenders."
Ikki says: "No!  That gift is mine!"
Jinora says: "You don't even like to read!"
Ikki says: "Eeeh!"
Pema says: "Yep, those are the world's next generation of  airbenders."
Meelo says: "Mommy, Daddy, look! I finally got a lemur! I'm gonna name him ... Poki!"
Meelo says: "Poki! Come back!"
Bumi says: "S'cuse me, a little help here?"
Acolyte says: "Sorry, I thought you were the servants."
Bumi says: "We're Tenzin's brother and sister!"
Acolyte says: "Avatar Aang had other children?  The world is filled with more airbenders?"
Kya says: "We're not airbenders."
Acolyte says: "Oh ...  I'm so sorry."
