Asami says: "Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way? It's going to be so uncomfortable."
Arik says: "Sorry Ma'am, I'm under orders."
Asami says: "Can't you just chain me to that railing?  I mean, where am I gonna go?  Please?"
Arik says: "Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference."
Asami says: "Thank you, Sir."
Korra says: "Can I have ... some water?"
Arik says: "No water. We're also not going to bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment 'til we reach Ba Sing Se."
Korra says: "I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay."
