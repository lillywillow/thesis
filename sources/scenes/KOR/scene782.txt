Amon says: "So, the Avatar has arrived early.  It looks like we'll have to accelerate our plans."
Main Korra Lin Naga Tenzin Antagonists Amon Lieutenant Triple Threat Triad Mushi Two Toed Ping Viper says: "Minor Chung Feathered hat man Gommu Ikki Jinora Katara Meelo Metalbender cops Oogi Pema Protester Ruffled police officer Saikhan Senna Tonraq White Lotus leader White Lotus sentries"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the Northern portal and trapped Jinora in the Spirit World. Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers. Everybody, that is, except Mako, whose pursuit of Varrick has landed him in the slammer. And in the Southern Water Tribe, Unalaq's army is nearing victory in the Civil War, but Tonraq isn't about to give up without a fight."
Meelo says: "Dad's back."
Pema says: "Where's Jinora?  No!"
Tenzin says: "Her spirit is trapped in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right."
Pema says: "How could this happen?"
Tenzin says: "It was all my fault.  I should have never let Jinora enter the Spirit World without me. I couldn't protect her."
Korra says: "I'm so sorry, Pema. I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me."
Tenzin says: "Don't worry, honey,  I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us."
