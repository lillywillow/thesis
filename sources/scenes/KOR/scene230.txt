Mako says: "Are you okay? How's your shoulder?"
Bolin says: "Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be all right.  Are we gonna be all right?"
Mako says: "Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry."
Bolin says: "Me too! Girls ..."
Mako says: "Seriously."
Shiro Shinobi says: "What an unbelievable effort here by Korra! She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her!  The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only ten seconds remaining, it might be too little too late!  It's the big kibosh! What a knockout!"
Bolin says: "Yes! She did it!"
Mako says: "Yes! Yeah!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!"
Bolin says: "Ha, ha!  Shoulder! Shoulder!"
Mako says: "Sorry."
Bolin says: "That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen."
Mako says: "Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would have made it this far without you. I owe you. Big time."
Korra says: "You're welcome. So ... I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends."
Mako says: "Definitely."
