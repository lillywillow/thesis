Asami says: "Are you sure this is a good idea?"
Mako says: "No, but it's our last resort."
Triple Threat doorman says: "Hey, Mako. Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it."
Mako says: "I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action."
Triple Threat doorman says: "How big a piece?"
Viper says: "So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?"
Mako says: "I am personal friends with that Avatar. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back."
Shady Shin says: "Sounds good to me, boss."
Viper says: "What about the rest of us?"
Asami says: "I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help."
Viper says: "I think we got ourselves a deal."
