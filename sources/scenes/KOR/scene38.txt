Korra says: "Uh, Naga what are you doing?  Naga, hush!  Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up!"
Bolin says: "Uh, What's going on?"
Korra says: "What, is, that?"
Bolin says: "Got it!  Don't got it!"
Tonraq says: "Korra!"
Tenzin says: "Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?"
Unalaq says: "Go in peace."
Tonraq says: "Korra!"
Tenzin says: "Are you all right?"
Korra says: "How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?"
Unalaq says: "As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know."
Tenzin says: "Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending. And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars."
Korra says: "Ugh"
Unalaq says: "The air temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar."
Tonraq says: "I've told you that will not happen!"
Korra says: "Hey! I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?"
Tenzin says: "Korra, please listen."
Korra says: "I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best. But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack.  I think it's time I had a new teacher."
Tonraq says: "Now Korraâ€”"
Korra says: "Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him."
Tenzin says: "Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together."
Korra says: "I'm sorry, Tenzin. This is as far as we go."
Tenzin says: "It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra."
