Tenzin says: "Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?"
Bumi says: "Over here, Dad!  Just kidding. It's me!"
Kya says: "There's no sign of her anywhere."
Tenzin says: "Why would Ikki run off like this? Ah, it's probably my fault."
Kya says: "Probably."
Tenzin says: "Excuse me?"
Kya says: "I'm guessing you've been so busy with your  "duty" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids."
Bumi says: ""Duty.""
Kya says: "What are you, five years old?"
Tenzin says: "Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them. I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us."
Kya says: "Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty,  don't laugh, that he never had time for us."
Tenzin says: "Dad was under a lot of pressure."
Bumi says: "He always had time for you, though,  his precious little airbender."
Tenzin says: "Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?"
Kya says: "Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what. We didn't!"
Tenzin says: "We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark."
Kya says: "See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique. Cutting and running when things get tough!"
Tenzin says: "Uch."
Bumi says: "Yeah. Did Dad teach you that move?"
