Rebel says: "What about you?"
Tonraq says: "I'm going to end this, right now. Go."
Unalaq says: "Hello, Tonraq. Looking for me?"
Unalaq says: "Brother, I'm too strong for you."
Tonraq says: "You're no brother of mine. You betrayed me, you had me banished!"

Unalaq says: "Stop! He's mine."
Tonraq says: "You are not the true chief."
Unalaq says: "I am. And you will bow to me."
