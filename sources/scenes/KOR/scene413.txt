Desna says: "Father, what are we doing here?"
Unalaq says: "You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar."
Desna says: "I told you, it wasn't our fault."
Unalaq says: "You're right. It was my fault for trusting you. Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us. This is my opportunity to change the world."
Eska says: "We'll make it up to you, Father."
Unalaq says: "Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal."
Desna says: "I thought only the Avatar could do it."
Unalaq says: "I believe there is another way."
Unalaq says: "This way."
