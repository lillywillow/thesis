Toph says: "Okay, bring it!"
Toph says: "Tell me what you did wrong."
Korra says: "Well, I was thinking that you were ..."
Toph says: "Exactly! You were thinking!  Go again."
Toph says: "Pathetic. Of all the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst. I know that's only one other Avatar,  but still."

Korra says: "So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?"
Toph says: "I'm more connected to the world than you've ever been! The roots and vines ... they run all over the world. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City. I see everything.  You're blind compared to me."
