Mako says: "I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off this ship."
Viper says: "Where do you think you're going?"
Viper says: "Get'm!"
Mako says: "They're getting closer."
Asami says: "Not for long."
Mako says: "Watch out! We're not gonna make it.  One down, one to go."
Asami says: "We're stalled."
Asami says: "Mako, hang onto something.  What was that all about?"
Mako says: "Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted."
Asami says: "Distracted? From what? Oh no."
