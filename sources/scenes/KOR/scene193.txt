Kuvira says: "The State of Yi is now under the full protection of my army.  Proclaim your loyalty, if you wish to keep your post."
Governor says: "I pledge my loyalty to you, oh Great Uniter."
Tenzin says: "Tonraq. It's good to have you back in the city. And everyone is excited to see the Avatar again."
Tonraq says: "What do you mean? Isn't Korra already here?"
Tenzin says: "No, we thought she was coming with you."
Tonraq says: "Korra left the South Pole six months ago. She's written me letters. She said she was here in Republic City."
Tenzin says: "I assure you, your daughter is not here."
Tonraq says: "Then where is she?"
