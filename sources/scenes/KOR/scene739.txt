Tenzin says: "Guru Laghima?"
Kya says: "Right ... you know I can never keep all those gurus straight. There were like a million of them. Remember that long, boring story about that guy who never ate?"
Tenzin says: "Yes ... I remember."
Air Acolyte member says: "Avatar Korra is calling on the temple's radio."
