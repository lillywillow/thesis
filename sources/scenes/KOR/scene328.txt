Suyin says: "Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc. They invented it all on their own."
Suyin says: "Oh, nice power, Wei."
Wei says: "Ha! Wing goes down!"
Suyin says: "I'm so proud of those two.  Huan, I'd like you to meet the Avatar and her friends. And your Aunt Lin."
Korra says: "Nice to meet you."
Huan says: "Hey."
Bolin says: "Wow, that's a really nice ... banana? Yes, very, very lifelike."
Huan says: "It's not a banana! It was inspired by Harmonic Convergence; represents the dawning of a New Age.  Obviously."
Bolin says: "Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that.  I can, oh, let me stand here. Yes, I can see that now. Yes. Thank you.  Banana.  I mean, that's a banana right?"
