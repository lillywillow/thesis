Ryu says: "Everyone! Mom! Can we stay together, please? The tour is about to begin."
Ryu's mother says: "That's my boy. Ryu, he used to live in the basement, but then he got airbending, and he's been doing important Air Nation stuff all over the world.  His father and I are here, visiting him and, we're just having the best time in the big city, we're so proud. Right, honey?"
Ryu's father says: "Well, at least he has a job now."
Ryu says: "Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work!"
