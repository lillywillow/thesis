Soldier #4 says: "It's Kuvira. She wants to talk to Baatar. What should I tell her?"
Raiko says: "For goodness' sake, give me that radio! Let me talk to her."
Raiko says: "Kuvira, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing? You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show."
Kuvira says: "What do you mean, "he didn't show"?"
Raiko says: "According to your people, he's not on the airship."
Kuvira says: "If he's not on the airship, then where is he?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Kuvira? It's Baatar.  I've been captured. My airship was ambushed and I was taken by force. Korra refuses to release me unless we back down and leave the city."
Kuvira says: "Are you injured?"
Baatar Jr. says: "I'm fine."
Kuvira says: "Is the Avatar there with you now?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Yes, everyone is here."
Kuvira says: "Find out where that signal's coming from."
Baatar Jr. says: "Listen to me.  If you try to take Republic City, the Avatar will never let me see you again ... and I refuse to live that way.  Forget the United Republic; we have our empire! We have each other!  Let's go back home and get married. The only thing that matters is that we're together for the rest of our lives."
