Bolin says: "You were just bluffing, right? I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?"
Kuvira says: "When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join."
Bolin says: "Other ... ways? How many ... times have we used these "other ways" in the past?"
Kuvira says: "It's not for you to worry about."
Bolin says: "So, uh ... what does happen to all those towns and villages after we leave? I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them."
Kuvira says: "Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit. Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths."
Bolin says: "Maybe ... I'm not really an "inner circle" kind of guy. Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu! Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, "Yay! The Empire's united! Congratulations to us!""
Kuvira says: "I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me. Zaofu will join us. The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp."
Bolin says: "I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills."
Baatar Jr. says: "Hard truths, Bolin."
Kuvira says: "Your loyalty seems to be wavering."
Bolin says: "No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal."
Korra says: "How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protégé."
Suyin says: "She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents. Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks. I saw myself in her."
Korra says: "What happened?"
Suyin says: "Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me."
