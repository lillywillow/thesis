Raiko says: "The borders are secure and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city.  So what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off Kuvira?"
Varrick says: "It's a flying mecha suit!  Asami got the idea from watching dragonfly-hummingbirds. You can take off straight up, fly in any directionâ€”"
Raiko says: "Where does the spirit ray come out?"
Varrick says: "It doesn't have a spirit ray. I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not be used!"
Raiko says: "It's already being used by Kuvira! I need spirit vine weapons and I need them now!"
Korra says: "No. It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people."
Raiko says: "You're supposed to be the bridge between the two worlds. Why can't you harvest the vines?"
Korra says: "I won't do that. But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow."
Raiko says: "Hm."
Wu says: "Okay, maybe while the weapon geniuses and the spirit bridge are getting ready for battle, we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt."
Raiko says: "That's ... actually a good idea.  Prince Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city. Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates."
