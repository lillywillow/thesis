Random spirit #1 says: "The all-powerful spirits are battling!"
Random spirit #2 says: "They're gonna wipe out the entire valley!"
Wan says: "Stop, or you'll destroy everything!"
Raava says: "This doesn't concern you, human!"
Wan says: "It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger."
Vaatu says: "If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free."
Raava says: "Don't involve the human. This is between us."
Vaatu says: "Please, save me. She has tormented me for ten thousand years."
Wan says: "Ten thousand years?  Let him go!"
Vaatu says: "Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits."
Raava says: "Do you realize what you've done?"
Wan says: "Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you."
Raava says: "You are gravely mistaken. I was keeping him under control."
Wan says: "And what gives you the right?"
Raava says: "You don't even know who I am, do you?"
Wan says: "Should I?"
Raava says: "Yes. My name is Raava.  That spirit you freed is Vaatu.  He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world.  And for the past ten thousand years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance,  until you came along."
Wan says: "So, by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?"
Raava says: "Precisely. The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation,  and it's all your fault."
Korra says: "Raava.  I found you."
