Bolin says: "Follow my lead."
Guard post soldier says: "Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?"
Bolin says: "You sure can. We captured these escaped prisoners. We need to get them to a secure facility."
Guard post soldier says: "Where did they escape from?"
Bolin says: "Camp fourteen."
Guard post soldier says: "Then why are you bringing them through here? Camp fourteen is the other way."
Bolin says: "You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is? Kuvira wants them transferred."
Guard post soldier says: "Then I'll need to see the transfer order."
Varrick says: "Listen pal! I had to fight off two badgermoles, six wolfbats and eighteen hog monkeys to capture these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork! I was too busy cramming it in a hog monkey's mouth, while it was trying to eat me! I am in sore need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy! So you can let us through, or you can give us your name and rank and I'll make sure to pass it on to Kuvira! You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders, don't you? Bad stuff!"
Guard post soldier says: "Let them through!"
Guard #2 says: "Wait! Stop them, they're traitors to the Empire!"
Baraz says: "There's no way I'm going back to prison!"
Varrick says: "Boy, I sure hope this works."
Varrick says: "I still got that Varrick touch!  We're clear, come on!"
Bolin says: "Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!"
Guard post soldier says: "Retreat!"
Baraz says: "Thanks. You didn't have to come back."
Bolin says: "Yeah. I kind of did. Let's go!"
