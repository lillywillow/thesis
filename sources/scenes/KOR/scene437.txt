Korra says: "Can't talk. Meditating."
Tenzin says: "You must be at the end of your rope. You hate meditating."
Korra says: "I thought if I really tried I might be able to contact my past Avatars, someone who knows something to help me, but I can't. They're gone and I'm all alone.  Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?"
Tenzin says: "You didn't ruin anything. You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have changed.  Change can be good or bad, depending on your point of view."
Korra says: "I know the people's point of view. It's bad."
Tenzin says: "You're not the President, Korra. Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City. Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire world, and that means no matter what you do, some people are not going to be happy about it."
Korra says: "Right."
Tenzin says: "On the other hand, some people will be very happy.  Like me. What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation, and that can only be good for restoring balance. That is the act of a great Avatar."
Korra says: "It's scary. I have all this power and all these people depending on me, but I don't know what I am supposed to be doing half the time. It seems like I should be ... wiser."
Tenzin says: "True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are. You've started a new age, Korra. There's no going back to the past."
Bolin says: "Mako called!  The cops found a new airbender guy, but when they tried to bring him in, he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and won't come down. Ooh sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?"
Korra says: "Avatar wisdom is the thing of the past, Bolin.  Come on."
Bolin says: "Oh okay. Is that a good thing?"
Korra says: "Depends who you ask."
