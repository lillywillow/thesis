Korra says: "I thought you said Bolin was coming?"
Mako says: "He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it. I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip."
Korra says: "Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine."
Unalaq says: "Tonraq, what do you want?"
Tonraq says: "I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole.  I'm coming."
Unalaq says: "Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done."
Tonraq says: "My daughter is not going without me! She needs someone to watch after her."
Korra says: "Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?"
Unalaq says: "Because he's misguided. The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since."
Korra says: "What happened in the past?"
Tonraq says: "It doesn't matter. What matters is the Everstorm."
Mako says: "The Everstorm?"
Tonraq says: "It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades.  I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me."
Bolin says: "Guys! Hey, wait for me!"
Bolin says: "Check it out,  I'm traveling in style!  Okay, uh, sorry, still getting used to that throttle."
Mako says: "Uh, where'd you get the ride?"
Bolin says: "Varrick; he's awesome! He also gave me this fancy snowsuit! It's inflatable, with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouches! I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like, like a month!  Who wants some freeze dried cucumberquats.  Nobody? ... Did I interrupt a conversation?"
Korra says: "No, the conversation is over.  Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training. ."
Eska says: "Does this sidecar have the capacity for two passengers?"
Bolin says: "Sure does. But, uh ... who's gonna drive?"
