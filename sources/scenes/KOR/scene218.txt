Korra says: "Did Dad send you to talk to me?"
Senna says: "Your father doesn't know I'm here.  Korra, what's going on between you two?"
Korra says: "Ask Dad."
Senna says: "I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this."
Korra says: "You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; how Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained; how Dad got banished from the North."
Senna says: "So, the truth is out."
Korra says: "You knew? And you never said anything."
Senna says: "We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood."
Korra says: "I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar. But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me."
Senna says: "That's not true, Korra."
Korra says: "No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?"
Senna says: "The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day."
Korra says: "So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?"
Senna says: "No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-"
Korra says: "Dad is part of a rebellion?"
Senna says: "I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it."
Korra says: "It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it."
Senna says: "Korra!"
