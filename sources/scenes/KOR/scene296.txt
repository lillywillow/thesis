Korra says: "Why did you bring me to the swamp?  Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time.  You should have told me who you were."
Light spirit says: "If I did, would you have followed me?"
Korra says: "I get your point. But why did you bring me here? What am I gonna find in the swamp?"
Light spirit says: "Not a what, a who."
Korra says: "No, wait!  Come back!"
Korra says: "You're just in my mind. You're not real."
Korra says: "Help!"
Unknown woman says: "Feeling better?"
Korra says: "Where am I? Wha-what happened?"
Unknown woman says: "I was hoping you could tell me. I found you passed out in the mud."
Korra says: "How'd you know I was out there?"
Unknown woman says: "I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here. What brings you to the swamp, anyway?"
Korra says: "A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you?"
Unknown woman says: "Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here, you should probably listen to them."
Korra says: "Wait, you recognize me?"
Unknown woman says: "In a manner of speaking. We were good friends in your previous life."
Korra says: "I can't believe it ... Toph?"
Toph says: "Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes."
