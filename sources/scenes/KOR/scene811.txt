Korra says: "Let's hide in the attic."
Mako says: "Uh, we're not alone up here."
Korra says: "Tarrlok?"
Tarrlok says: "I don't suppose you're here to rescue me."
Korra says: "We had no idea you were here. Are there other prisoners on the island?"
Tarrlok says: "No, I'm the only one."
Korra says: "And what makes you so special?"
Tarrlok says: "I'm Amon's brother.  Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.  He's a waterbender and a bloodbender,  just like I was."
Korra says: "What?"
Mako says: "Did you know this all along?"
Tarrlok says: "No,  not until after he captured me."
