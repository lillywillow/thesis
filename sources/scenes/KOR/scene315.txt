Jinora says: "Looks like you got some bad berries.  So much for living off the land."
Meelo says: "They're fine, I just ate too many of them because they're so ... so delicious."
Jinora says: "Did you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?"
Meelo says: "No, what? Did she run off or something?"
Jinora says: "I think so."
Meelo says: "Great. Now I've got to go find the Avatar and her. This mission is getting worse by the day."
Jinora says: "This isn't only your mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a family."
