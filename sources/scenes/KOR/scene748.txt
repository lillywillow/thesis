Bumi says: "Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders on these parts. And you never mess with an airbender's bison."
Daw says: "Without my shaved head, I'd never could have dodged that net. I really felt it coming at me. You guys should totally get shaved."
Tenzin says: "I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad."
Bumi says: "I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt that I was a part of the Air Nation before."
Tenzin says: "You are now."
