Suyin says: "Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I guess you had something to do with her decision."
Lin says: "Well, I was just ..."
Suyin says: "It's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy. Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's about time I let her choose her own way.  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ..."
Lin says: "You'd probably be in prison."
Suyin says: "You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud.  Can we move on? I'd love for you to be part of my life again. There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around. I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance."
Lin says: "Whoa! Slow it down. How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again?"
Suyin says: "Deal!"
