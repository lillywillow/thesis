Bolin says: "You looked like  you were just sitting on a pillow."
Varrick says: "Are you saying I wasn't levitating?"
Bolin says: "Uh ... no?"
Varrick says: "Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot!  Swami, you're fired!  I like you, kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Miss Sato, he's with you?  Brought your tiger shark with ya to do business, huh? Now that's moxie!  Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests!"
Asami says: "Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping."
Varrick says: "Sure! But first you gotta check out my new venture! Moving pictures! Zhu Li, do the thing!  You're gonna love this!  Mind-blowing, right?"
Bolin says: "Yeah."
Varrick says: "Now forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li!  Imagine watching this!  Ginger, come over here and do your poses."
Varrick says: "Spectacular! And, we tell a story; there's romance,  action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever! Thanks, Ginger, go rest your gams.  How about that tiger shark? We're gonna do big business with these movers as I call them."
Asami says: "Okay ... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a deal ..."
Varrick says: "Stop! Look me in the eye."
Varrick says: "We got a deal!  We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight.  Now, who wants a rocket boat ride?"
Bolin says: "Is that how business usually goes?"
Asami says: "You are a natural assistant!"
