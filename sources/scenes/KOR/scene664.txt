Katara says: "What happened?"
Tenzin says: "Her soul is trapped in the Spirit World."
Katara says: "Oh my goodness! How long has she been away?"
Kya says: "Almost a week. I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away. You're the only one who can help her now, Mom."
Tenzin says: "How much longer can she survive like this?"
Katara says: "I don't know, but she is very strong to have lasted this long."
