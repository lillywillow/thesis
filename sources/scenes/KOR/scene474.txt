Mako says: "Well, what do you know? Looks like--"
Bolin says: "Go away, Mako."
Korra says: "So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?"
Unalaq says: "You will open an ancient spirit portal."
Korra says: "I'm sorry, what now?"
Unalaq says: "At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed."
Korra says: "And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?"
Unalaq says: "There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all. But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over.  If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored."
Korra says: "What do you mean ... in time?"
Unalaq says: "There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal."
Korra says: "The winter solstice is tomorrow."
Unalaq says: "Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year."
Korra says: "Easy, Naga."
Bolin says: "What are those?"
Korra says: "Dark spirits."
Tonraq says: "Let's keep moving. We have to find a safe place to set up camp."
