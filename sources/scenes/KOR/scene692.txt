Korra says: "Jinora."
Korra says: "Jinora."
Jinora says: "Korra! Where are you! Hello? I'm lost.  Can anyone help me?"
Jinora says: "Furry-Foot?  Is that you?  It's so good to see you again!  You're so big here.  I don't suppose you know where Korra is, do you?  We were supposed to go find the spirit portals,  but I don't know how to find anything down here."
