Mako says: "My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation. I got to admit, I'm impressed. I think you're going to make a great leader.  But that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra, so don't ask."
Wu says: "That's okay, Mako. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward."
Korra says: "Good to see you, Prince Wu. Or should I say, King Wu? You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?"
Wu says: "Yeah  ... about that  ... I was actually thinking of stepping down as king and getting rid of the monarchy all together."
Mako says: "Are ... you joking?"
Wu says: "For once,  I'm not. Now I know what you're gonna say, I'm being lazy, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things. I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders, like the United Republic."
Mako says: "That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you."
Korra says: "I think it's a great idea. The Earth Kingdom should evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen."
Wu says: "Looking forward to working with you. But for now, the dance floor calls."
Korra says: "How's the arm?"
Mako says: "Much better."
Korra says: "The words "thank you" don't feel big enough for what you did. But I honestly don't know what else to say."
Mako says: "You don't need to say anything. I want you to know, I'll follow you into battle, no matter how crazy things get. I've got your back  ... and I always will ."
