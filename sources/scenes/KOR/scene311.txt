Pema says: "Tenzin, are you sure you can't go with them?"
Tenzin says: "Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem."
Ikki says: "Mom, we'll be fine. Grandpa Aang and his friends were around our age when they traveled the world."
Pema says: "Well, at least I don't have to worry about you starving out there."
Meelo says: "Mom, we're going to be out in the wild, living off the land! We don't need your food!"
Pema says: "But I made your favorite treat ..."
Meelo says: "Sweet buns with happy faces on them?  Well, I guess we're not officially on the road yet.  Aww, this one is smudged.  I can't eat this."
Pema says: "You know, sometimes things get smudged in the wild."
Tenzin says: "We're you able to get a read on Korra yet?"
Jinora says: "No, but once we're further out, I'll be able to hone in on her spiritual energy. We should be able to find her within a few days."
Tenzin says: "Good luck! And be careful! Remember, Jinora's in charge!"
Meelo says: "I answer to no man. Or girl, even if she does have tattoos."
Tenzin says: "Meelo ..."
Meelo says: "Now let's move out, soldiers!"
Jinora says: "Ugh ... Pepper, yip-yip!"
