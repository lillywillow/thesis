Katara says: "I've tried everything in my power,  but ...  I cannot restore Korra's bending."
Lin says: "But you're the best healer in the world, you have to keep trying!"
Katara says: "I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed."
Tenzin says: "It's going to be all right Korra."
Korra says: "No, it's not."
Mako says: "Korra, wait."
Korra says: "Go away."
Mako says: "I will, but I just want you to know, I'm here for you."
Korra says: "No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City. Get on with your life."
Mako says: "What are you talking about?"
Korra says: "I'm not the Avatar anymore. You don't need to do me any favors."
Mako says: "I don't care if you're the Avatar or not. Listen,  when Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again, I realized ...  I love you, Korra."
Korra says: "I - I can't."
Mako says: "Korra!"
