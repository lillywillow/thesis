Gommu says: "And who is the recipient of this top secret message?"
Iroh says: "Commander Bumi.  Second division of the United Forces."
Korra says: "Tenzin's brother?"
Iroh says: "Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet."
Gommu says: "Ready, sir."
Iroh says: "Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear.  Now comes the hard part. We need to ground those aircrafts. Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city."
Mako says: "They flew in from this direction. The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range."
Iroh says: "Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn."
Asami says: "It's time to take down my father."
Korra says: "Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow."
Mako says: "What?"
Asami says: "Why not?"
Korra says: "I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon. It's time I face him."
Iroh says: "That's not a good plan. We need to stick together."
Korra says: "I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down. My guts tell me it's time to end this, on my terms."
Iroh says: "Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone."
Mako says: "She won't be.  I'm going with you."
Korra says: "You don't have to do that."
Mako says: "Yes, I do."
