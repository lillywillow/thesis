Korra says: "My dad's in there.  Where is he?"
Unalaq says: "I'm sorry, Korra. You'll never see your father again."
Korra says: "Where's my father?"
Unalaq says: "On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe. He'll serve out his sentence there."
Korra says: "Bring him back. Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army."
Unalaq says: "Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity."
Korra says: "You don't want unity. You want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him."
Unalaq says: "All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny."
Korra says: "Well, I don't want your help anymore."
Unalaq says: "If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South. And even I will be powerless to stop them."
Korra says: "I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North."
Unalaq says: "And why would I do that?"
Korra says: "Because you still need me to open the Northern portal."
Unalaq says: "No, I don't. You've served your purpose."
Mako says: "If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father."
Korra says: "Let's go."
Northern soldier says: "You have a license for that animal?"
Bolin says: "Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?"
Varrick says: "Zhu Li, do the thing."
Excited man says: "That platypus bear is pooping money!"
Bolin says: "Where's your dad?"
Korra says: "On a ship headed north. Think we can catch up to it?"
Varrick says: "Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North."
