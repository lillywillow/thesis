Opal says: "Mom! Dad!  Thank you."
Lin says: "Let's move."
Opal says: "Kuvira caught Zhu Li and threw her in the town."
Bolin says: "What?  No, I have to go save her."
Lin says: "You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. Kuvira's onto us."
Bolin says: "We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it."
Toph says: "For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake."
Bolin says: "No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow."
Opal says: "Bolin, no!  You guys get out of here. I have to go with Bolin."
Suyin says: "Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira."
Lin says: "Maybe take out that weapon."
Wing says: "We can't let Opal be the coolest!"
Toph says: "If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business. I'm through."
Suyin says: "Watch out for Baatar Sr. and Huan."
Baatar says: "So how have you been, mother?"
Toph says: "I told you never to call me that."
