Korra says: "This looks scary. Will you come with me?"
Iroh says: "This is something that you must do on your own. The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger. So that is what you see now. But you have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you. Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened. But does he seem scary to you now?"
Korra says: "No!"
Iroh says: "Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them. It was good to meet you. Come visit me again - in this life, or the next."
Korra says: "Bye! Okay, time for you to go home. Light and peace ... light and peace ..."
