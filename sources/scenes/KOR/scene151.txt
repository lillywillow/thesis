Chou the Elder says: "Tell me who else was involved in the rebellion, and I might take mercy on you."
Wan says: "I'm not telling you anything."
Chou the Elder says: "Then, you've left me no choice.  Wan, you are hereby banished."
Little Chou says: "Yeah!  And give back the fire you stole."
Wan says: "No! Wait. Great lion turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds."
Lion turtle says: "Never again may you return to this city.  But  I will allow you to keep the power of the element."
