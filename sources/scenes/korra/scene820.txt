Tenzin says: "I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders."
Korra says: "Those people should not be forced to join an army!"
Bumi says: "Well, technically, the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens.  What? It's true."
Jinora says: "Guys, what if Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too."
Bolin says: "Probably not. He's surprisingly difficult to catch, like aâ€” like a little, greased hog-monkey."
Jinora says: "But, what if he was?"
Korra says: "Don't worry, Jinora. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look."
Mako says: "I bet they're under Lake Laogai.  What? I've been reading some of Jinora's books. The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake."
Jinora says: "Mako's right! It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders, and I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it!"
Bumi says: "You mean that out-of-body thing you did to help giant, spirity Korra?"
Tenzin says: "You can still do that?!"
Jinora says: "It's not as powerful as it was during Harmonic Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it."
Korra says: "Let's go get Kai out. Let's get all the airbenders out."
