Mako says: "One ... two ... three!  Nothing's happening!"
Bolin says: "Kuvira must've done some override thing and taken control!"
Mako says: "There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here."
Bolin says: "Ummm ..."
Mako says: "Come on. You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?"
Bolin says: "Look, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much,  they explode."
Mako says: "Get those engineers out of here. I have an idea."
Bolin says: "Want to fill me in?"
Mako says: "I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity."
Bolin says: "Let's back it up, okay?  I said that will make the vines explode."
Mako says: "Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down.  I can handle it."
Bolin says: "No! You can't! This isn't the time to prove how awesome you are. I already know how awesome you are  ... you're awesome."
Mako says: "I don't have time to argue!  I'm doing this, so get out of here!"
Bolin says: "Okay, but for the record,  I do not approve. Just,  get out as soon as you can.  Promise?"
Mako says: "Promise."
Bolin says: "I love you."
Mako says: "I love you, too. Now go!"
