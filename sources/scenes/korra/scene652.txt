Asami says: "Pretty cool, huh?"
Korra says: "Way cooler than a makeover."
Asami says: "This is where Future Industries test-drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?"
Korra says: "The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog."
Asami says: "You want me to take you for a spin?"
Korra says: "Let's do it!"
Korra says: "That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it."
Asami says: "Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes."
Korra says: "I gotta admit, I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of ... prissy.  Eh-No offense!"
Asami says: "It's all right, people usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self-defense classes since I was this high.  My dad made sure that I would always be able to protect myself."
Korra says: "Smart guy."
