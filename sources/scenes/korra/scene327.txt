Korra says: "You two haven't spoken in thirty years? How come?"
Suyin says: "Ask her, I've tried."
Lin says: "Oh, don't put that on me.  You're the one who tore our family apart."
Suyin says: "And you've done a bang up job keeping it that way."
Lin says: "You haven't changed one bit, have you?"
Suyin says: "Look, we can stay here arguing about the past all day, but that's not reason the Avatar came here.  My daughter is thrilled to meet you."
Korra says: "Lin, your niece is the new airbender! Isn't that amazing?"
Lin says: "Yeah. Terrific."
