Suyin says: "And this is my daughter, Opal."
Opal says: "Wow, Avatar Korra.  I can't believe you're here. You are so amazing."
Korra says: "It's great to meet you, Opal."
Bolin says: "Opal. That's a beautiful name."
Opal says: "Thanks."
Bolin says: "I'm Bolin."
Opal says: "Opal.  But, uh, you already knew that."
Lin says: "Great. We've found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here."
Suyin says: "And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your aunt Lin."
Opal says: "Really? I've always wanted to meet you. My mom has told so many stories about you."
Lin says: "I'm sure she has."
Suyin says: "So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses while Korra trains Opal."
Korra says: "Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple."
Opal says: "That sounds amazing."
Suyin says: "Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are. You can train her here."
Korra says: "I guess I could help her get started."
Lin says: "Absolutely not! We're leaving."
Korra says: "She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me."
Suyin says: "If you're concerned about security, don't be. This is the safest city in the world.  Now I'll see you all at dinner. And come hungry. My chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth."
Korra says: "Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice.  Come on, we can stay a little while."
