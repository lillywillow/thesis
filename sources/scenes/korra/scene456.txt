Bolin says: "Wouldn't I be cold wearing this outfit in the snow?"
Varrick says: "Ah, Nuktuk is never cold."
Bolin says: "Ohhh.  Hey, Ginger."
Varrick says: "How about that, huh? It's the latest product in my Varri-manageable Hair Line: Varri-dye! We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her, I guarantee we sell a million cases week one."
Korra says: "Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone."
Bolin says: "Where are you going?"
Korra says: "The Fire Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South.  I need a boat."
Varrick says: "What happened with General Iroh?"
Korra says: "He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up. Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami."
Bolin says: "And Mako."
Korra says: "Mako?"
Bolin says: "What?  There's no way Mako would have told.  Right?"
