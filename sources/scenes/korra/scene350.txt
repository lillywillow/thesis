Tenzin says: "I have to go. Call me back the minute you hear anything.  Lin? Wh-wh-what are y- What are y- You should be in the hospital! And you three!  You should be in prison!"
Lin says: "I figured you could use our help finding Korra."
Mako says: "Do you have any leads?"
Tenzin says: "I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet."
Mako says: "We need Naga! She can track Korra."
Tenzin says: "I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well."
Bolin says: "Then where do we start?"
Lin says: "My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city."
Asami says: "Underground ... just like my father's secret factory. Figures."
Bolin says: "Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense! When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!"
Mako says: "I know where to start looking! Come on!"
Lin says: "Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too."
Tenzin says: "Let's bring them all home, Lin."
