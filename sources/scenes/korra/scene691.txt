Jinora says: "Isn't it beautiful?"
Korra says: "Just ... stick close to me, okay? This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits. Huh!"
Jinora says: "Look! It's like it's made of jewels!  The spirits are so much more beautiful in their own world than they are at home."
Korra says: "Jinora, be careful! Hold on!  Uh!"
Meerkat spirit #1 says: "Hey! Watch where you're going, you giant clod!"
Korra says: "Sorry!"
Meerkat spirit #1 says: "This is a residential area, in case you hadn't noticed. Who do you think you are, stomping through here like that?"
Korra says: "I'm the Avatar."
Meerkat spirit #2 says: "The Avatar? Â Not impressed."
Korra says: "I'm trying to find the spirit portals? I opened one-"
Meerkat spirit #3 says: "I heard Unalaq did that!"
Korra says: "No, I did, but-"
Meerkat spirit #4 says: "Well if you opened it, how come you don't know where it is? Huh?"
Korra says: "B-because I was at the South Pole!"
Meerkat spirit #5 says: "I don't trust her."
Meerkat spirit #6 says: "Get out of our world!"
Meerkat spirit #7 says: "We don't need you!"
Meerkat spirit #8 says: "You don't belong here!"
Korra says: "Get away from me!"
Meerkat spirit #1 says: "Did you guys see that?! She tried to bend at us, in our own holes! Get her!"
Korra says: "Jinora!"
Jinora says: "Korra! Stay calm! Your energy is upsetting them. You're only making it worse!"
Jinora says: "Ahhh!"
Korra says: "Jinora!"
Korra says: "Jinora? Jinora!"
