Tenzin says: "It's like a dream, Dad. After a hundred and seventy years, new airbenders."
Ikki says: "Dad.  When that new guy's airbending, does that make him our brother?"
Tenzin says: "Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family."
Ikki says: "Does that mean I have to share my room? Because I like my personal space."
Tenzin says: "Of course not. But we might have to get used to not being the only airbenders around anymore."
Meelo says: "I hope we have enough for an army.  I want to be Commander like Uncle Bumi."
Jinora says: "Air Nomads don't have armies, Meelo."
Tenzin says: "But maybe, there will be enough to fill the temples again."
Jinora says: "What's wrong, Daddy?"
Tenzin says: "I just wish your grandfather was here to see this."
Meelo says: "Will you be airbender President?"
Tenzin says: "No, but I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be part of our nation. That's a big responsibility."
Meelo says: "Don't worry dad, we'll help you."
Tenzin says: "I know you will."
