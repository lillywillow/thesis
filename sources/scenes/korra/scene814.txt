Tarrlok says: "My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak. We thought he perished in that storm. My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother.  My father stopped training me. With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered.  And he passed away, a few years later."
