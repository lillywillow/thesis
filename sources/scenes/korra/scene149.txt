Wan says: "Hand over all the food you're hoarding,  and we won't give you any trouble."
Big Chou says: "You're not getting past us.  We have the weapons.  You're powerless."
Wan says: "Powerless, huh?"
Wan says: "Follow me!"
Wan says: "Grab as much food as you can."
Jaya says: "Maybe you're right.  Maybe we do have the power to change things."

Wan says: "Get everyone out of here. I'll hold them off."
Little Chou says: "No, please! Have mercy!"
Little Chou says: "Wan?"
