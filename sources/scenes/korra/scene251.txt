Asami says: "Are you okay?"
Korra says: "I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan?"
Asami says: "I don't know. But I think I found a clue."
Korra says: "Xai Bau's Grove, sundown. This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!"
Asami says: "All right. Xai Bau's Grove, where are you?  Go away! I'm trying to find something."
Bolin says: "Well, aren't you a cute little spir-  Ow! Hey!"
Mako says: "No luck here."
Bolin says: "I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!"
Mako says: "We've been made. Let's lose 'em!"
Mako says: "Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us."
Bolin says: "We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead.Â  Look!"
Mako says: "All right.  Stay cool and follow my lead."
Bolin says: "Ting-Ting always finds his man."
Mako says: "Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra."
