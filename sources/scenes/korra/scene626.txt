Hou-Ting says: "No, to your left! Your other left!  Do you have these problems with your servants?"
Korra says: "I don't really have servants. But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se."
Hou-Ting says: "Airbenders in Ba Sing Se. Where did you hear that?"
Korra says: "Before we left Republic City we got some reports."
Hou-Ting says: "Hmm. Well, before I even consider helping you, I'll need you to do something for me."
Korra says: "Oh, of course. What is it?"
Hou-Ting says: "I have a vault full of tax money sitting in a town south of here. Barbarians have stolen my past two shipments. Go collect my money and bring it back here."
Korra says: "Yes, Your Majesty."
