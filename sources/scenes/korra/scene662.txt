Hiroshi Sato says: "Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run.  Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!"
Bolin says: "Oh no."
Mako says: "Korra was right. We gotta do something, quick!"
Hiroshi Sato says: "Not so fast, boys."
Bolin says: "Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow! What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion."
Mako says: "Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover."
Hiroshi Sato says: "Yes, and the most difficult part was watching my daughter traipse around with a firebending street rat like you!"
Asami says: "Dad, stop!  Why?"
Hiroshi Sato says: "Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this as long as I could.  But now you know the truth, please, forgive me.  These people,  these benders. They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world, but with Amon we can fix it and build a perfect world together. We can help people like us, everywhere!  Join me, Asami."
Mako says: "No ..."
Asami says: "I love you, Dad."
Mako says: "Let's get out of here!"
