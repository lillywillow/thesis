Amon says: "I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City.  So once again, the Wolfbats are your pro-bending champions.  It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory because every day,  you threaten and abuse your fellow nonbending citizens  just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight.  Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to  cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there:  if any of you stand in my way,  you will meet the same fate.  Now, to my followers: for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows, but now we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City.  I'm happy to tell you that the  time for change has finally come. Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime will be replaced by a fair-minded Equalist government. You and your children will no longer have to walk the streets afraid! It's time to take back our city."
Mako says: "How are we gonna get out of here?"
Bolin says: "Pabu! Listen up, buddy."
Mako says: "Stop fooling around!"
Bolin says: "I'm not! I'm trying to save us!  See? Pabu's not just a one trick poodle pony."
Amon says: "For centuries, benders have possessed an unnatural advantage over ordinary people.  But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field.  Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand.  My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality, and once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world.  The revolution has begun!"
Lin says: "Tenzin!"
