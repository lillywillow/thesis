Korra says: "Uncle!  Oh, no. Uncle?  Dad?  Dad, don't do this."
Rebel says: "Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything."
Korra says: "No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped. We can still avoid a war."
Rebel says: "No, we can't."
Rebel says: "Get him out of here!"
Korra says: "We're all part of the same tribe. I don't wanna hurt you."
Korra says: "Dad, stop!  Why did you do this, Dad?  What? Who are you? Where's my father?"
Rebel leader says: "He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you."
Unalaq says: "Thank you for saving my life."
Korra says: "I'm just glad I got here in time."
Unalaq says: "Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors."
Korra says: "Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier."
Unalaq says: "You want them to go free?"
Korra says: "No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right."
Unalaq says: "Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter."
Korra says: "Thank you, Uncle."
