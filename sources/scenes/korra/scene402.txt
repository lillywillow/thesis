Korra says: "Raiko surrendered.  It's down to us now."
Bolin says: "How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?"
Asami says: "We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.  Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?"
Zhu Li says: "I had no idea they were even building it."
Varrick says: "Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought.  Don't tell him I said that."
Korra says: "That's it! Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down! I say we capture him, and get him to talk."
Tenzin says: "Hmm ..."
Korra says: "I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ..."
Tenzin says: "Korra, I'm in."
Korra says: "We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving."
Meelo says: "What about me?"
Korra says: "Sorry, buddy. This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible -  - and your farts are just too much of a wild card."
Meelo says: "I can be quiet!  Okay, point taken."
