Shiro Shinobi says: "Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarter finals, which get underway way tonight. The rookies are about to take on the former and longest-reigning champs, the Boar-q-pines. Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather of the ages.  Korra dodges and, ooh, slams right into her teammate! Down goes Mako and Bolin and Korra!"
Ring announcer says: "Round one goes to the Boar-q-pines!"
Mako says: "You were supposed to defend while I attacked!"
Korra says: "I had an opening so I took it!"
Bolin says: "What is up with you two? All right, whatever, just pull together, guys."
Shiro Shinobi says: "The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two. Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks, he's a one-man bending battalion. The Ferrets are having a rough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two. Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabaroos."
Ring announcer says: "Round three is a tie! We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match."
Referee says: "The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!  Which element do you choose?"
Mako says: "I got this."
Bolin says: "I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one.  We choose earth."
Shiro Shinobi says: "Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off. Bolin goes in for the grapple, Chang reverses. Bolin strikes from midair, knocking Chang to the edge of the circle. Another strike from Bolin, and Chang is in the drink!"
Ring announcer says: "The Future Industries Fire Ferrets win their quarterfinal match!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Oh, that was a close one folks! Youth trumps experience tonight."
