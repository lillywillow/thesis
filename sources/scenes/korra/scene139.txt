Suyin says: "Thanks for coming to save us, Mom."
Lin says: "Yeah, thanks, Chief.  I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just ... you know."
Toph says: "Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway. If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me."
Lin says: "Me too."
Bolin says: "You know, I never had any family except for my brother  until a few years ago,  and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is."
Toph says: "Argh, enough!  Enjoy the ride back to the city  with the gum flapper here."
Opal says: "Aren't you coming back to Republic City with us, Grandma?"
Toph says: "No, my fighting days are over. Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that civil war nonsense. At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids."
Zhu Li says: "I want to thank you for coming back to save me. And don't be too hard on Bolin for working with Kuvira. His heart was in the right place."
Opal says: "I think Bolin has worked his way out of the polar bear doghouse."
Bolin says: "Yes!"
Zhu Li says: "We should get going. I'm afraid I have bad news to deliver to Republic City.  Kuvira is going to attack in two weeks."
