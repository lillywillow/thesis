Kai says: "Sorry what I've said got you into trouble with your dad."
Jinora says: "It's not your fault. He just can't believe that I'm growing up now and I don't need him telling me what to do like one of his recruits."
Kai says: "I know something that'll cheer you up."
Jinora says: "Where did all the spirits go?"
Kai says: "Where are the babies?"
Ganbat says: "What are these kids doing in my camp?"
Rustler #1 says: "We caught them sneaking around. Thought they might tell someone we're here."
Ganbat says: "They're the new airbenders. Must be living up in the temple. Hurry up and gather the rest of the gang and let's get out of here before someone comes looking for these kids. I'll take them to Ba Sing Se, with the rest of the fresh meat."
Tenzin says: "Tattoos. How could she think? Focus. Breathe. Bumi ruins everything. Inhale. Focus."
Pema says: "Taking a little break from teaching?"
Tenzin says: "I've failed. Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?"
Pema says: "You know, just because these people can airbend, it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads."
Tenzin says: "Tell me about it."
Pema says: "I remembered when I moved down my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night I was so scared and lonely and the bed was so hard."
Tenzin says: "It's actually better for your back.  Sorry."
Pema says: "The point is: I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust to feel like I was a part of it all. The people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient."
Tenzin says: "Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.  Thank you, Pema."
