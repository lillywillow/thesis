Tenzin says: "Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there."
Korra says: "I don't know what to do. I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us."
Bumi says: "Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little razzle-dazzle."
Bolin says: "Yeah, razzle-dazzle! We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!"
Bumi says: "I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!"
Korra says: "It sounds ridiculous, but it might work."
Tenzin says: "I'm willing to try anything at this point."
Bolin says: "Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!"
