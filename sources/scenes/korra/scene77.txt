Lin says: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with the Avatar."
Tarrlok says: "You do?"
Korra says: "Yeah, you do?"
Lin says: "I expected this kind of cut-and-run response from Tenzin.  But the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists."
Tenzin says: "We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war!  The council is not changing its position, Lin."
Tarrlok says: "Now just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind."
Lin says: "If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no better force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks."
Tarrlok says: "Are you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena?"
Lin says: "I guarantee it."
Tarrlok says: "It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record.  If she is confident her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote.  Who else is with me?  The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals."
Bolin says: "All right!"
Mako says: "Yeah!"
Korra says: "Thank you!"
Tarrlok says: "And good luck to you, Chief Beifong."
Tenzin says: "A word please, Lin."
