Tenzin says: "I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something."
Toph says: "What are you doing here, Aang?  I told you, I have this under control."
Aang says: "Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal."
Toph says: "Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes."
Aang says: "Toph, I'm forty years old. You think you could stop with the nicknames?"
Toph says: "'Fraid not."
