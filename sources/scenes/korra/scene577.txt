Raiko says: "Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow. We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that."
Mako says: "And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?"
Raiko says: "When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent. She gave me her word that she'd step down."
Tenzin says: "Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here."
Korra says: "You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.  I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The world needs me."
Toph says: "Get over yourself! The world doesn't need you one bit."
Korra says: "But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things."
Toph says: "Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my butt off busting criminals. But did that make crime disappear? Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same."
Korra says: "So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.  And I thought Beifong was grumpy."
Toph says: "I'm the original Beifong!"
Korra says: "So ... you're not going to train me?"
Toph says: "Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks.  But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time. All right, I guess I can help."
Korra says: "Thank you!"
Toph says: "Na-uh-uh-uh. You want to hug something,  go hug a tree.  We're here to work!"
