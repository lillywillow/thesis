Zaheer says: "I met your uncle when I was a teenager, after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu, and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the world forever."
Korra says: "Avatar Wan wasn't foolish! He was trying to restore balance."
Zaheer says: "He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways."
Korra says: "So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?"
Zaheer says: "Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much."
Korra says: "It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted."
Zaheer says: "No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the world."
