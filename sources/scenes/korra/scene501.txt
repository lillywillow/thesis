Bolin says: "Kale, kale, kale ... Opal ..."
Bolin says: "What?  What's going on?  Pabu, sleep!"
Bolin says: "Huh? What? Oh, Pabu.  It's not play time right now. Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk-  What the heck?! They've got Korra. They've got Korra!"
Mako says: "Let her go!  They've got Korra!"
Ming-Hua says: "So much for the element of surprise."
Ghazan says: "Back-up plan."
Mako says: "We can't let them take her."
Asami says: "I don't think they're going to get far. Look!"
Kuvira says: "We have you surrounded. It's over. Release the Avatar!"
Bolin says: "No way! That guy is lavabending! That's awesome ... ly not good for us."
Zaheer says: "I'm going to create some cover. We've got to get out of here!"
Lin says: "How did they get in here?"
Suyin says: "I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!"
Asami says: "There's no way to cross that moat."
Suyin says: "We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables."
Lin says: "That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us."
Suyin says: "She's a combustionbender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily."
Mako says: "Bolin can land a shot."
Bolin says: "I can?"
Suyin says: "You have to take her out right before we drop down."
Bolin says: "I do?"
