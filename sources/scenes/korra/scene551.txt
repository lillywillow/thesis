Shiro Shinobi says: "This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Aaaaand she's in the drink."
Korra says: "Oh, hey, Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches."
Tenzin says: "Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island! Let's go."
Korra says: "No! I'm kind of in the middle of something."
Tenzin says: "I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient,  but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple right now!"
Korra says: "Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending?  You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!"
Tenzin says: "What? That is a ludicrous suggestion!  The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It isÂ not optional!"
Korra says: "No! This is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!"
Tenzin says: "Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra!  When will you learn that?"
Korra says: "I have a match to go finish."
Ring announcer says: "The Platypus Bears win round two!  Round three!"
