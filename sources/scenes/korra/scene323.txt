Bolin says: "Yeah!"
Asami says: "Aren't you coming?"
Lin says: "What's there to see? It's metal. Big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving. Don't tell anyone I'm here."
Korra says: "Why not?"
Lin says: "I don't need to explain myself to you.  Just do what I say."
Korra says: "Fine.  You got it, Chief Crankypants."
Aiwei says: "Avatar Korra. It is an honor to meet you.  My name is Aiwei."
Korra says: "Thanks for having us."

Korra says: "Yup.  Just us. So, can I meet the new airbender?"
Aiwei says: "Of course,  right this way."
Ikki says: "And this is the Air Acolyte dining hall where everyone eats. And this is Daw.  He's a new airbender too,  like you guys."
Daw says: "It's so nice to meet you. How exciting. New friends."
Zaheer says: "Excuse me, hello?  My name is Yorru.  I heard this is the place to come for if you're a new airbender."
Meelo says: "You got that right, stranger."
Zaheer says: "Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I can do this."
Ikki says: "Mom!  Aunt Kya!  We got another one!"
