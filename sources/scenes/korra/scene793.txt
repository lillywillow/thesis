Ginger says: "I can't believe my boyfriend is a real life hero!"
Bolin says: "Boyfriend? Wait, stop. I thought you said we weren't a couple."
Ginger says: "You really are as dumb as those rocks. Of course we're a couple."
Asami says: "Bolin you saved the president! And you proved Mako was right all along. We have to go tell him what happened."
Bolin says: "Yeah!  Oh, you meant right now."
Korra says: "President Raiko!"
Raiko says: "Avatar Korra? What's wrong?"
Korra says: "Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore. He wants to destroy the whole world."
Bolin says: "Unalaq is going to destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?"
Korra says: "He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over. Sir, we desperately need your help."
Raiko says: "I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
Tenzin says: "There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them! Raiko, you must reconsider!"
Raiko says: "I'm aware that lives are on the line. And that's precisely why my troops are staying here. If the world is going to be thrown into chaos as you claim, I need to protect my citizens. I'm sorry."
Bolin says: "Sir, Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people."
Raiko says: "Son, I appreciate you saving my life and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
Bolin says: "Never should have saved that guy."
Asami says: "If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
Bolin says: "Yeah, me too."
Korra says: "Thank you. It's so good to see you guys again.  Wait. Where's Mako?"
