Tenzin says: "Wait.  I have done my best to guide Republic City toward the dream my father had for it, but you're right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy,  but you are his legacy.  You may stay and train airbending here with me.  Republic City needs its Avatar once again."
Korra says: "Yes! Thank you! You're the best!"
Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora says: "Yaaaaay!"
Korra says: "Hello?  I'm Korra,  your new Avatar."
Male journalist #1 says: "Does this mean you've moved to Republic City?"
Female journalist says: "Were you trying to send a message to the Triads yesterday?"
Male journalist #2 says: "Will you be fighting crime or the Anti-bending Revolution, or both?"
Male journalist #3 says: "Will you be working with Chief Beifong and the police?"
Korra says: "Uh ... yes, I am definitely here to stay, but honestly I - I don't exactly have a plan yet.  See, I'm still in training, but, look, all I know is  Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world, and I believe we can make his dream a reality.  I look forward to serving you!"
