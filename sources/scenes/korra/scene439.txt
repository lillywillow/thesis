Daw says: "Stay back! I'm dangerous."
Daw says: "Sorry!"
Korra says: "Don't panic, I'm just here to talk."
Daw says: "Please, I don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to hurt anyone."
Korra says: "Tell me about it. Rough day, huh? I'm having kind of a rough day myself. You mind if I sit down here?"
Daw says: "Huh."
Korra says: "Look, I know you're scared. You've gone through a big change and its kind of my fault. But you're not alone, there are other airbenders and they want to help you. Actually, they are really excited to meet you."
Daw says: "I don't want to be an airbender. Please, you're the Avatar, make it stop. Ahh!"
Korra says: "I'm sorry, I can't, but I promise you things will get better if you just give it a chance. Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through. Okay?"
Daw says: "Oh! Ahh!"
Korra says: "Daw, this is Tenzin. He is going to help you."
Tenzin says: "It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw. I have never met a new airbender before. Well, at least not one whose diaper I didn't have to change."
Daw says: "Actually, I just fell off a bridge so I could use a fresh diaper right about now."
Raiko says: "So, is this the deal?  We have crisis every other day now thanks to you."
Korra says: "Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes and I'm sorry for that, but you and everyone else are going to have to learn live with it. The vines and the spirits are here to stay."
Raiko says: "Well, you know who's not here to stay?  You! I order you to leave this city. You've caused nothing but trouble since you arrived."
Korra says: "Don't worry, I was already leaving."
Korra says: "I can see my path now. There are new airbenders out there and I'm going to find them and rebuild the Air Nation."
Tenzin says: "Don't think I'm not going with you. It's so exciting. Who knows who's out there now, discovering the gift of airbending for the first time?"
