Meelo says: "Poki, sit!  Roll over.  Good boy."
Tenzin says: "Well done, Meelo! I knew you could learn to train Poki."
Meelo says: "Not just Poki. I trained all the lemurs. Watch!"
Tenzin says: "I've created a monster.  Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now. Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?"
Meelo says: "Thanks, dad, training makes me tired. Come on, Poki."
