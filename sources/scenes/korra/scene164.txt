Lin says: "Radio the second you see those airbenders."
Mako says: "I will, Chief. Good luck."
Asami says: "Be careful, Korra."
Korra says: "You too."
Tonraq says: "Korra."
Korra says: "Don't worry, Dad. I'll be all right."
Tonraq says: "I just want you to know how proud I am of you. The risk you're taking to save the Air Nation will be remembered for generations."
Korra says: "I love you, Dad."
Tonraq says: "I love you too, sweetheart."
Korra says: "And Dad, watch out for Zaheer. He's not very fond of world leaders."
Tonraq says: "I can handle him. Just stay focused on your mission."
Bolin says: "Oh, man."
Mako says: "Must have been some fight."
Korra says: "Mako, did you see the airbenders?"
Mako says: "Not yet. We're just arriving. Don't turn yourself over until I get a visual on them."
Ghazan says: "This way.  You want the airbenders, or not?"
Zaheer says: "Drop your staff and surrender yourself.  Don't make me come get you."
Korra says: "Mako, what's going on?"
Mako says: "They're here. And so is the lavabender."
Korra says: "Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go."
Zaheer says: "Not 'til you turn yourself over. This isn't a negotiation.  Wipe them out!"
Korra says: "No! Wait. I'm coming."
Zaheer says: "Stand down."
P'Li says: "Don't bother trying to metalbend out of these: they're platinum."
Zaheer says: "We have her."
Asami says: "It's okay, Tenzin. We're about to get you out of here."
Mako says: "Korra, it was a trick! They're not here. Don't turn yourself over!"
Korra says: "We had a deal!"
Mako says: "Chief, get Korra out of there. Now!"
Lin says: "Go! Go!"
P'Li says: "Get the Avatar on the airship. I'll deal with them."
Tonraq says: "Nowhere to go, Zaheer!"
