Huntsman says: "Finally, we caught something.  Get it down."
Wan says: "Back off."
Huntsman says: "Wan? What are you doing here?"
Wan says: "I'm saving this animal."
Huntsman says: "That animal's our dinner. Now, get out of the way."
Wan says: "No!"
Hunter #3 says: "Ahh! He-help! Help!"
Hunter #4 says: "Get 'em off! Get 'em off!  Ahh!"
Huntsman says: "Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan."
Aye-aye spirit says: "I. Really. Hate. Humans!"
Huntsman says: "No, no!"
Aye-aye spirit says: "I don't know what he's screaming about.  He's better looking now."
Wan says: "I feel great. What's in this water?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "It has special healing properties."
Wan says: "Thanks.  So what did you do to that hunter?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Spirits are able to take over a human body for a short time. If I stayed in there any longer, I would've killed him, which I did consider."
Wan says: "Thanks for saving my neck. But why'd you do it?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "I saw you save the cat deer from those hunters. I've never seen such an act of selflessness from a human before."
Wan says: "Told you I wasn't like the others."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Guess I underestimated you, human."
Friendly spirit #2 says: "Are you off to find another lion turtle city?"
Wan says: "I was. But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "What a great idea."
Friendly spirit #2 says: "That'll be fun."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Oh, now, now, hold on. A human living with spirits? It's never been done."
Wan says: "First time for everything, right?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Hmm. I guess we can try it. I've never had a human as a pet before. I think I'll call you "Stinky.""
Wan says: "The name is Wan."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Stinky is more accurate."
