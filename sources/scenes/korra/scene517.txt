Mako says: "Korra, look.  What are those?"
Korra says: "It's Jinora and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World."
Mako says: "Let's get them out."
Korra says: "Don't! You'll provoke the vines. Let me try.  They won't open.  Maybe if I meditate into the Spirit World, I can free them."
Korra says: "Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World."
Korra says: "Zaheer! No!"
Zaheer says: "You can't fight me and the poison!"
Korra says: "No ... I got it out!"
Zaheer says: "You'll never get it out!"
Mako says: "Korra! What's wrong?"
Korra says: "It's Zaheer."
Mako says: "What are you talking about?"
Korra says: "He's been haunting me ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace. It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World."
Mako says: "I'm here for you. What do you need?"
