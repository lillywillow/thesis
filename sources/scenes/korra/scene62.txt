Korra says: "Mako, I missed you so much!"
Mako says: "Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too.  So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?"
Korra says: "Not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?"
Mako says: "Ahhhhh ...  Hmmmm, no. No. It-it wasn't that bad."
Wu says: "Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?"
Yin says: "Just like your grandfather."
Mako says: "Well, me and Asami were never officially back together."
Tu says: "Really? That again? You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone."
Wu says: "Truer words have never been spoken.  High-five!"
Mako says: "Well, eventually, I did tell Korra. But by then, she already knew."
