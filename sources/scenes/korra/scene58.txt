Mako says: "Asami. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you."
Asami says: "I care about you, too."
Wu says: "Wait. Was that supposed to be you breaking up with her?"
Mako says: "Yes. That was a breakup."
Tu says: "Didn't sound like a breakup."
Mako says: "It was mutual. We had an understanding!  We both knewâ€”  Can I just get on with the rest of my story or what?"
Wu says: "Fine.  But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami."
Mako says: "Trust me, I wasn't."
