Mako says: "Korra? You out here?"
Bolin says: "Korraaa!"
Bolin says: "There you are.  Are you okay?"
Korra says: "I'm fine."
Mako says: "Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us."
Korra says: "How am I suppose to save this city when I can't even learn airbending?  I'm the worst Avatar ever!  I just feel ... alone."
Asami says: "No, that's nonsense! You're amazing!"
Mako says: "Yeah and remember. Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid."
Bolin says: "And he wasn't alone. He had his friends to help him. Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team. The new Team Avatar!"
Mako says: "We got your back Korra, and we can save this city.  Together."
Korra says: "Yeah, let's do it!"
Meelo says: "Yeah, let's do it!  What are we doing?"
