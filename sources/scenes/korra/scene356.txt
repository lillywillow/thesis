Aang says: "Yakone.  You won't get away with this!"
Yakone says: "Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll be back one day to claim it."
Yakone says: "This time I'm gonna put you to sleep for good!"
Aang says: "I'm taking away your bending, for good.  It's over."
Korra says: "Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok."
Tarrlok says: "My life is a disaster now, thanks to you."
Korra says: "So your little bloodbending secret's out?  And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon.  You're Yakone's son."
Tarrlok says: "I was his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else. My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly. My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior. But you, you ruined everything!"
Korra says: "Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go."
Tarrlok says: "Oh no. No, I'll escape and start a new life. And you're coming as my hostage."
Korra says: "You'll never get away with this!"
Tarrlok says: "Amon!"
