Korra says: "So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing."
Tonraq says: "My own brother betrayed me. And our entire tribe."
Rebel leader says: "What's our next move?"
Tonraq says: "I've been running from my past for too long. It's time to put my brother in his place."
Rebel leader says: "You have our support, Chief Tonraq."
Korra says: "Mine too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad."
Tonraq says: "No, Korra."
Korra says: "But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces. I can help."
Tonraq says: "The best way for you to help is by getting the president of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while. But we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war."
Korra says: "All right, I'll get you all the help you need. I love you, Dad."
Tonraq says: "I love you, too."
Bolin says: "I really need to thank you, Korra."
Korra says: "For what? I started a civil war."
Bolin says: "Exactly! Now Eska and I are officially broken up."
Varrick says: "Oh, looks like we have company! And not the fun kind!"
