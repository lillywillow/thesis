Tenzin says: "Thank goodness you're all okay."
Korra says: "Did you find Jinora?"
Tenzin says: "I was able to rescue her soul, but she wasn't ready to return to her body yet.  She sensed that the world was in grave danger."
Korra says: "She was right."
Tenzin says: "Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?"
Korra says: "No. They fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. Vaatu won."
Bolin says: "No. I am too young to live through ten thousand years of darkness. Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?"
Korra says: "When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too."
Tenzin says: "If that's true, then-"
Korra says: "The cycle is over. I'm the last Avatar.  I'm so sorry, Tenzin."
