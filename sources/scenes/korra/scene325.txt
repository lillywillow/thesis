Korra says: "Is this some kind of combat training?"
Aiwei says: "Not exactly, they are rehearsing for a dance premiere next month."
Suyin says: "That's it for today everyone."
Aiwei says: "Allow me to introduce the matriarch of the Metal Clan, Suyin."
Suyin says: "Please call me Su.  Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.  And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami."
Mako says: "You've done your research."
Suyin says: "I make it my business to know who's visiting my city."
Korra says: "So, you're a dancer."
Suyin says: "Dancer. Leader. Wife. Mother. Collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interests.  Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?"
Korra says: "What? I, uh, I didn't. I mean ..."
Bolin says: "Oh ..."
Korra says: "How did you know I was lying?"
Aiwei says: "I'm a truth seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase.  I can sense the most subtle of changes."
Suyin says: "Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city."
Korra says: "We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
Suyin says: "Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello."
Korra says: "Wait, you two know each other?"
Suyin says: "You're joking, right?  Lin never told you about me."
Korra says: "No. Why would she?"
Suyin says: "I'm Lin's sister."
