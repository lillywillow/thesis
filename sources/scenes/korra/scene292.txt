Senna says: "Everything all right, sweetie?"
Korra says: "There's something I need to tell you both."
Tonraq says: "What is it?"
Korra says: "I want to go back to Republic City."
Senna says: "Are you sure?"
Korra says: "I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is,  where my friends are."
Tonraq says: "I'll have the White Lotus prepare a boat and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready."
Korra says: "No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head. It'll be good for me."
