Mako says: "We found Aiwei hiding in an inn."
Korra says: "That's great!"
Asami says: "We found something too.  It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove. But I can't find it anywhere on the map."
Korra says: "Let's go bust down Aiwei's door and finally get some answers."
Mako says: "No. Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him."
Korra says: "And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer."
