Korra says: "Two lobster crabs, please."
Fishmonger says: "Why, you're the Avatar, ain'tcha?"
Korra says: "Yup, that's me."
Fishmonger says: "I can't believe it! Mind if I took a picture for my "Wall of Avatars"?"
Korra says: "Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry."
Fishmonger says: "I-it'll only take a second!  Avatar Aang was a big fan of my seaweed wraps, you know, so,  I named 'em "Aang Rolls"!  Now they're my biggest seller! And they ain't even got fish in 'em!  Now, smile!"
Fishmonger says: "But if I coulda met any Avatar,  I'd have to pick Kyoshi. Taking down a shark squid with one hand! Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know!"
Vendor says: "Thieves! Get back here!"
Fishmonger says: "Oh, don't worry, the Avatar's right here!  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go get 'em!"
Korra says: "Hand over the bags or else."
Vendor says: "You sure she's the Avatar?"
