Korra says: "That was terrible."
Toph says: "Hah! Maybe for you. I had a great time! I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar  I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun."
Korra says: "You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long."
Toph says: "I know! And I'm an old lady! Imagine me in my prime!  I would have destroyed you!"
Korra says: "I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self. It's like ... I'm a step slower. I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove."
Toph says: "Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help."
Korra says: "What metal?"
Toph says: "The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body. Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body? You really are the worst Avatar ever."
Korra says: "I thought Su got it all out."
Toph says: "Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me."
Korra says: "That's been my problem this entire time! I gotta get it out! You can get it out for me, right?"
Toph says: "Who do you think you're talking to?"
