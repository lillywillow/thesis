Bolin says: "Come one, come all.  See Pabu the fantastic fire ferret as he crosses the Ladder of Peril,  upside down!  Psst, psst.  Big finish, buddy. Stick the landing.  Ta da!  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! You are too kind! Seriously, too kind! You can come back here and put money right in this-  Okay, that's fine, that's fine.  One yuan down, 29,999 to go."
Shady Shin says: "Hey, Bolin. Is that you?"
Bolin says: "Oh, hey there, Shady Shin."
Shady Shin says: "Heard you're a big time pro-bending player now. Not bad."
Bolin says: "Uh, thanks."
Shady Shin says: "So listen. I got an offer for ya. Lightning Bolt Zolt is lookin' to hire some extra muscle."
Bolin says: "Uh, I don't know, Shin. Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats."
Shady Shin says: "Pfuh, your brother ain't the boss of you.  It's just a little security work. Nothin' crooked."
Shady Shin says: "You game?"
