Katara says: "Whenever you're ready."
Korra says: "What's the point? We've been at this for almost six months and I can still barely take a couple of steps without collapsing!"
Katara says: "I know you're frustrated, butâ€”"
Korra says: "Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do anything for myself! And this whole time, my friends have been off helping the world while I'm stuck with you and you can't even heal me!"
Korra says: "That came out wrong."
Katara says: "It's ... all right.  Let your anger and frustration flow like water."
Korra says: "I am trying to understand why this happened to me,  but nothing makes any sense!  I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired."
Katara says: "Korra, I know you feel alone right now. But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.  Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?"
Korra says: "That ... must have been so awful."
Katara says: "But he never let it destroy his spirit.  He chose to find meaning in his suffering and eventually ... found peace."
Korra says: "And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?"
Katara says: "I don't know.  But won't it be interesting to find out?"
Katara says: "Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.  Can you see it?"
Korra says: "Yes."
Katara says: "Now ...  take that first step."
Korra says: "Where'd you come from, little cutie?"
Korra says: "You can see her, too?"
