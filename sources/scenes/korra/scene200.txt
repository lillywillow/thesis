Jinora says: "Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible."
Opal says: "Stop her, we should be helping her."
Korra says: "We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is. If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse. All we can do now is wait."
Kuvira says: "Attention citizens of Zaofu. Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody."
Opal says: "No."
Kuvira says: "Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all."
Opal says: "Korra, you can't let Kuvira get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!"
Jinora says: "You swore an oath of non-aggression when you became an airbender.  You can't just attack Kuvira!"
Opal says: "I don't care about the oath! I have to save my family!"
Korra says: "No, Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself."
Opal says: ""Defending herself"? She was going to attack our city! I can't believe you're refusing to fight!"
Meelo says: "Why is that loudspeaker lady talking when I'm trying to sleep?"
Baatar says: "Korra, what are we going to do?"
Korra says: "Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out. I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace."
Opal says: "I'll go with you."
Ikki says: "We'll go, too."
Jinora says: "No! Dad told us to find Korra, and we did. Now you need to stay safe."
Ikki says: "Come on! Let us help!"
Korra says: "I can't risk anyone else being captured. You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira.  Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong."
Meelo says: "Aw, man! When am I gonna see some action?"
