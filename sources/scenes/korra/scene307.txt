Korra says: "Hey!"
Tenzin says: "I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?"
Korra says: "I don't know! These knuckleheads won't tell me anything."
Tenzin says: "I'll take care of this.  Saikhan, a word please."
Saikhan says: "Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?"
Tenzin says: "No, it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately."
Saikhan says: "They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business."
Korra says: "Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists. They should be released, too."
Saikhan says: "All Equalists suspects are being detained indefinitely. They'll be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat."
Tenzin says: "Those people are entitled to due process under the law."
Saikhan says: "You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok."
Tenzin says: "Oh, I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning."
Korra says: "You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!"
Tenzin says: "Calm down, Korra. Â I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.  But you really are the worst!  Ever!"
