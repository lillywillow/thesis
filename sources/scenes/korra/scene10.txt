Asami says: "How's it looking in there?"
Korra says: "I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean."
Kong says: "Hasn't been this clean since it floated off the showroom floor."
Korra says: "How's it going out here?"
Asami says: "Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?"
Kong says: "Aye aye!"
Arik says: "All right!"
Korra says: "That's no spirit!  I think it's gone now."
Arik says: "Kong, are you all right? What are we going to do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water."
Captain says: "Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours."
Asami says: "We might not have a few hours."
Korra says: "How far are we from the edge of the desert?"
Captain says: "Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking."
Arik says: "We can't just wait around to for that thing to pick us off one by one!"
Captain says: "You'll do as you're told, Airman. Now get a hold of yourself!"
Asami says: "Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here."
Captain says: "You want to make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?"
Asami says: "No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to."
Korra says: "It's worth a try."
Captain says: "Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet."
