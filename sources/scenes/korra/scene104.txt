Suyin says: "I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us. Kuvira turned my own son against me, and together they plotted behind my back."
Suyin says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Kuvira says: "We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom."
Suyin says: "No! You will stay here!"
Kuvira says: "And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage."
Suyin says: "If you leave now, you will never be welcomed back."
Kuvira says: "When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms."
Suyin says: "Kuvira and Baatar left that day with Varrick, my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens. After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,  Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here."
Korra says: "I want to fix this."
Suyin says: "You can. Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all."
Korra says: "Fighting is something the old me would do. That always made things worse. Let me talk with Kuvira. Maybe I can reason with her."
Suyin says: "Kuvira doesn't listen to reason."
