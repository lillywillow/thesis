Korra says: "Eska, Desna, listen to me.  You've got to help us stop Unalaq. I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
Eska says: "We will never turn on our father."
Korra says: "Please.  If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything.  Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
Desna says: "You don't know what you're talking about!  Our father is the wisest man in the world. If he says what he is doing is right, I believe him."
