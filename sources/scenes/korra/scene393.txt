Lin says: "Air Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations and you'll be safe here."
Korra says: "There's something we need to discuss with you."
Tenzin says: "What is it?"
Korra says: "The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets too close to the city."
Tenzin says: "That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place."
Korra says: "I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ..."
Bolin says: "It's too powerful! It can destroy the city."
Mako says: "We can't let it get to our doorstep."
Korra says: "We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon."
Asami says: "If it works, it'll even the playing field."
Tenzin says: "But if you get caught ..."
Korra says: "It's worth the risk."
Raiko says: "I agree, and it might be our only shot at preventing an all-out war.  Good luck."
Korra says: "We'll head out tonight."
