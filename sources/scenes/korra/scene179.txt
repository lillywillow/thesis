Baatar Jr. says: "Where am I? Mom?"
Suyin says: "Just rest, son. I'm here."
Baatar Jr. says: "Mom, I'm so sorry. I betrayed you, the whole family. I gave my life to Kuvira and she just fired that weapon at me. How could she do that?"
Suyin says: "I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person."
Baatar Jr. says: "Wing and Wei will never forgive me. And Opal."
Suyin says: "Yeah, they might take some time to come around. But we'll work through it as a family."
