Main Asami Sato Bolin Korra Lin Beifong Mako Suyin Beifong Antagonists Aiwei Ghazan Ming-Hua P'Li Zaheer says: "Minor Baatar Baatar Jr. Chef Hong Li Huan Kuvira Opal Beifong Varrick Wei and Wing Zhu Li"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Korra is safely back in Republic City, but Bolin and Varrick are still on the lam! Weeks ago, Korra removed the remaining poison from her body, but the memory of Zaheer's attack still torments her and, after being defeated by Kuvira, she questions if she will ever fully recover.
