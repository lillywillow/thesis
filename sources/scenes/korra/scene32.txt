Unalaq says: "It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits.  Even during the most hallowed times."
Korra says: "I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun."
Unalaq says: "This festival  used to be a solemn time of fasting  and meditation. Now it's just  a chance to watch some rube try to stick an  entire arctic hen in his mouth."
Bolin says: "What? Oh, it's so good."
Tonraq says: "Traditions change. It's not the end of the world."
Unalaq says: "Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters.  Some traditions have  purpose."
Korra says: "Wait,  spirits are attacking ships?"
Unalaq says: "I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe."
Korra says: "I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits.  Airbending is getting pretty boring."
Tonraq says: "Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs."
Unalaq says: "So you've said."
