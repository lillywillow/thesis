Korra says: "I can't believe we didn't find anything."
Lin says: "It would appear Hiroshi is innocent."
Asami says: "Okay, you did your search. Now you can all leave."
Lin says: "Hmm."
Mako says: "So, I hope you're convinced now."
Korra says: "No, I'm not! I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying."
Mako says: "Why are you doing this? Are you that jealous of me and Asami?"
Korra says: "What?  Don't be ridiculous! That has nothing to do with it!"
Mako says: "If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over."
Korra says: "I'm sorry. Hiroshi is not the man you think he is."
Mako says: "Hmph."
Korra says: "I think you guys should hear this.  "If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight.""
