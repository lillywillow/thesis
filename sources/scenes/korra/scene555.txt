Korra says: "I'm really sorry ... about everything I said.  I was really frustrated with myself,  and I took it out on you."
Tenzin says: "I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine."
Korra says: "No hard feelings?"
Tenzin says: "Of course not. By the way, you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an airbender!"
Korra says: "Wait ...  You stayed and watched?"
Tenzin says: "I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you."
Korra says: "I'll see you tomorrow for airbending practice, bright and early!  And, by the way, I kinda permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks!"

Shiro Shinobi says: "A chance encounter turns Korra from pro-bending spectator to pro-bending star. With her new teammates, Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the championship tournament. But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution brews in Republic City. Who are the Equalists? And what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero?"
Korra says: "What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?  The morning is evil."
Bolin says: "We're the rookies,  so we get the worst time slot in the gym."
Mako says: "And you're the rookiest of us all. We gotta get you up to speed if we wanna survive in the tournament.  Deal with it."
Korra says: "You deal with it!"
