Lin says: "I'll pass, thanks."
Asami says: "We just got a call from the radio about another airbender."
Korra says: "Finally! Where are they?"
Mako says: "A city called Zaofu,  the home of the Metal Clan."
Korra says: "You know the place?"
Lin says: "Uhh ... Never been there.  But I don't want you going there. I would rest a lot easier if you were back at Republic City."
Korra says: "Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next."
