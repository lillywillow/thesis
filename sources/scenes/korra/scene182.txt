Pema says: "Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves. Hungry little lemur, ate up all my trees.  Okay, great job everybody. Who's got another song for us?"
Evacuee says: "We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured, or worse."
Pema says: "Should we play the button game? Who has a button?"
Pema says: "Where do these badgermoles come from?"
Wu says: "The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!"
Evacuee says: "Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?"
Wu says: "They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us."
Evacuee says: "Are you sure this is the best plan?  Let's follow the moles!"
Wu says: "Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty."
Kuvira says: "Mech platoons, report."
Third platoon says: "Third platoon, no sign of anyone so far."
Fourth platoon says: "Fourth platoon, en route to train station."
Soldier says: "I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse:  Future Industries Tower."
Kuvira says: "That's the place."
