Asami says: "Where're the airbenders?"
Tenzin says: "I don't know. Zaheer moved them out of the temple."
Ming-Hua says: "Won't you just bury them already?"
Asami says: "Come on.  We have to get to the airship."
Bolin says: "Not gonna happen. The exit's blocked."
Asami says: "Where's Oogi?"
Tenzin says: "Gone. All the bison got scared off during the attack. But, I think I know another way out. Bolin, can you get us to that wall?"
Bolin says: "On it!"
Tenzin says: "Through there."
Bolin says: "Is it just me, or is it uh, getting really warm in here?  Oh, this is not good.  Let's move it, people!"
