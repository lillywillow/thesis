Korra says: "I talked to the rebels. They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded.  Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away."
Tenzin says: "Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now."
Korra says: "There's no use in talking any more. We know what our mission is."
Bolin says: "A suicide mission ..."
Bumi says: "You know, I was in a similar situation once. My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week! But when we finally located the only oasis for a hundred miles,  it was surrounded by angry sandbenders. I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.  So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog monkeys ..."
Tenzin says: "Enough of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!"
Asami says: "Hold on, maybe Bumi's right.  We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above."
Korra says: "What are you thinking?"
Asami says: "Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening."
Korra says: "Let's get moving."
