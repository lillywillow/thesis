Mako says: "Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?"
Korra says: "I think she's still sulking in her room."
Suyin says: "I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night.  All set for your power disc game, guys?"
Wing says: "Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt."
Wei says: "I wanna power disc your face.  You should go play with us."
Korra says: "Um. I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend."
Suyin says: "Really. Lin never offered to train you?"
Korra says: "Nope. And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists. It was a busy few months."
Suyin says: "Well, it's probably for the best. I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher.  As the Avatar, you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics."
Korra says: "Really? That would be great!"
Opal says: "You should try it, too."
Bolin says: "Uh, nah. I'm more of an earth guy. The dirt, rocks; y'know, maybe some light gravel. That's kinda where my heart is."
Suyin says: "Okay, Earth Guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind."
Varrick says: "It worked! Zhu Li, mark it down. Magnet suit test successful.  Power down.  On to phase two: Zhu Li cleans up this mess."
