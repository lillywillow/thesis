Tenzin says: "You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead?  Yes, you do.  You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional."
Ikki says: "We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too."
Tenzin says: "Let's not. They'll only spoil our good mood."
Ikki says: "What do you mean? Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling, and Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world."
Tenzin says: "But what about Meelo? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle."
Ikki says: "And mean. And bossy.  Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?"
Tenzin says: "I couldn't agree with you more."
Ikki says: "But, I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you. Even though  Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other."
Tenzin says: "That's very wise of you, Ikki."
Ikki says: "We should probably head back, huh?"
Tenzin says: "I suppose. We can't hide in this cave forever."
Ikki says: "Don't worry, Daddy. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her."
Tenzin says: "Yes, I'd like that."
