Korra says: "I'll be right back."
Korra says: "Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?"
Bathroom attendant says: "Sorry miss, I haven't seen him."
Wu says: "Hmm, I'm in laundry ..."
Korra says: "They've got Wu! Get the car, I'm going after them!"
Asami says: "Get in!"
Korra says: "We're losing them!"
Mako says: "Hang a right at the next block. We can cut them off on Seventh."
Mako says: "You missed the turn! Where are you going?!"
Asami says: "I know these streets better than you. I built some of them!"
Mako says: "What are you doing? Sit down!"
Korra says: "Where is he?"
Korra says: "Wu's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck."
Mako says: "Where's the prince?"
Bathroom attendant says: "Halfway to Kuvira by now.  All hail the Great Uniter."
Asami says: "They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them."
Mako says: "Take this guy in for booking. Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all-points bulletin. We'll keep looking."
Asami says: "Where do we start? There are thousands of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them."
Mako says: "Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship."
Asami says: "Or maybe a boat."
Mako says: "He could be anywhere!  The one time I don't watch him pee and this is what happens."
Korra says: "They're taking Wu to the train station!"
Asami says: "Are you sure? How do you know?"
Korra says: "I'll explain on the way, just drive! We're running out of time!"
