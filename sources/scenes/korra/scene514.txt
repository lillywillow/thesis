Bolin says: "Opal, wait! Please,  I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything."
Opal says: "I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for "sorry"."
Bolin says: "I know, I know.  I didn't listen to you, and I  sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your  mom captured, and  your brothers, and your dad ...  Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you."
Lin says: "Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal.  Privately.  I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira."
Opal says: "So our family ..."
Lin says: "Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves."
Opal says: "Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?"
Lin says: "This is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone."
Mako says: "Bolin, I'm so glad you're back. I was worried about you."
Korra says: "We all were."
Bolin says: "Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm so sorry about the way we left things. I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right and I'm just an idiot. I hope ... that ... I'll be able to earn your trust again."
Korra says: "If anyone has lost people's trust, it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around."
Mako says: "We want you around.  And Bolin, you're not an idiot. You were just doing what you thought was right."
Bolin says: "Aww, I love you guys. And I really wanna hug again."
