Wan says: "Do you see that, Mula?  People. And they have some kind of wind power.  More humans!  I found you.  Wait! I'm friendly!"
Wan says: "The legends are true. Another lion turtle city. And it's flying. Â I have got to get over there.  There. Okay, Mula. Wish me luck.  Oh, no--.  Wow.  Hi, how are you? I'm Wan.  Um, sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans."
Nomad says: "Where did you come from, stranger?"
Wan says: "Another lion turtle city far away. For the past two years I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds."
Nomad says: "Remarkable. Come. Sit with us. We would love to hear of your travels."
Wan says: "Vaatu."
Vaatu says: "So, we meet again, human."
Nomad says: "Why is the great spirit of the darkness here but not his other half?"
Wan says: "Uh, I'll explain later.  Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you."
Raava says: "Be gone."
Vaatu says: "How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever."
Raava says: "I told you not to interfere."
Wan says: "I had to do something. These people were in danger."
Nomad says: "Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu?"
Raava says: "Ask him."
Wan says: "It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could."
Raava says: "It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes."
Wan says: "He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller."
Raava says: "As darkness grows, light fades."
Wan says: "I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right."
Nomad says: "How?"
