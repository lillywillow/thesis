Mako says: "This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet."
Two Toed Ping says: "I agree. Keep quiet. Mouth zipped, don't say a word. That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing. I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and -"
Mako says: "Two Toed Ping, please."
Two Toed Ping says: "Oh, right. So, what's it like dating the Avatar.  Come on, Mako, I gotta know."
Mako says: "Ping, stay focused!"
Two Toed Ping says: "What? What are you so weird about it? If I was dating the Avatar, I'd tell you all about it."
Mako says: "There's nothing to know.  I broke up with her."
Asami says: "You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?"
Mako says: "I don't know."
Two Toed Ping says: "Yeah, right. You broke up with the Avatar. Like that happened. Hey, Shady Shin, Viper. Mako says he broke up with the Avatar."
Shady Shin says: "Sure he did."
Viper says: "Yeah, I did too."
Mako says: "All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?"
