Roh-Tan says: "Nuk-no!"
Nuktuk says: "You can't die Juji! Not on my watch!"
Juji says: "It's okay, Nuktuk. At least ... I got to be  your friend."
Nuktuk says: "Juji!"
Asami says: "Are you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?"
Bolin says: "Of course I know. Juji's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry."
Asami says: "Then what's wrong?"
Bolin says: "I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing ... business-lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart."
Asami says: "I know. Things have changed to much since we first met.  Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?"
Bolin says: "You go ahead. I need another another minute.  That's weird."
