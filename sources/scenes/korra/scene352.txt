Asami says: "Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra."
Bolin says: "Yeah, we all are!"
Asami says: "I know, but, he's your brother. Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?"
Bolin says: "W-What? No! That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that?  Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh ..."
Asami says: "What do you know, Bolin? Come on, spill it."
Bolin says: "Nothing! I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-"
Asami says: "They ... kissed?"
Bolin says: "Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it. I don't think it meant anything."
Asami says: "I doubt that."
Lin says: "Hide!"
Equalist traffic director says: "That tram goes to the training camp."
Female Equalist says: "Everything was delivered to the prison, sir."
Tenzin says: "That's where they must be keeping Korra."
Lin says: "We need to get down that tunnel."
Equalist says: "It's empty!"
Equalist says: "Yeah, I can see that."
Lin says: "You two, keep an eye on them."
Lin says: "My officers are inside."
Mako says: "What about Korra?"
Lin says: "I don't see her yet."
Mako says: "Avatar Korra. Where are you keeping her?"
