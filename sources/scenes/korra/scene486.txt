Korra says: "Trees frozen in the ice."
Unalaq says: "It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North."
Korra says: "So, what do I do?"
Unalaq says: "You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies. From here, you're on your own."
Mako says: "Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone."
Bolin says: "Yeah! If she goes,  we go, too!"
Unalaq says: "The Avatar must go alone."
Korra says: "But I don't have any connection with the spirits. In fact, it seems like they hate me."
Unalaq says: "You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you.  What is it?"
Korra says: "I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me."
Unalaq says: "Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark."
Korra says: "Wait here, I'll be okay."
Mako says: "Good luck."
