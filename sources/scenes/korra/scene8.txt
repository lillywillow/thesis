Mako says: "We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra."
Prisoner says: "Take me with you. I haven't seen my wife and five kids for four years."
Bolin says: "Four years?"
Prisoner says: "The first few months were great, I-I could finally get some sleep, but ...  now I really miss them."
Mako says: "Listen. Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend."
Prisoner says: "You can metalbend?"
Bolin says: "No."
Mako says: "Yes you can. I believe in you."
Prisoner says: "I believe in you too, Bolin."
Bolin says: "I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man. But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it. Not even a little."
Mako says: "You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the motivation. But this is your time! Get us out of here to save Korra. You can do it!  Bolin! Bolin!"
Other prisoners says: "Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!"
Bolin says: "You're right.  Okay, here I go. Metalbending.  I can't metalbend."
Other prisoners says: "Aww!"
Prisoner says: "Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, do you?"
