Gun says: "Your Majesty, may I present Avatar Korra."
Hou-Ting says: "You're ruining the koi pond! It's completely overshadowed by the topiaries! Guards, take that buffoon away and get me someone who knows what they're doing!"
Hou-Ting says: "You, rip everything out and start over!"
Hou-Ting says: "I am surrounded by idiots.  So, I finally get a visit from the Avatar. Let me guess, you want something."
Korra says: "Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ..."
Hou-Ting says: "I hardly think you're in a position to ask me for favors after everything the last Avatar did to the Earth Kingdom.  He and Fire Lord Zuko took advantage of my father's weakness and stole our lands to make their own little empire.  The United Republic is Earth Kingdom territory!"
Korra says: "Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that."
Hou-Ting says: "Not that you care, but what's left of my kingdom is falling to ruin. Roving bands of barbarians are raiding villages in the countryside. And now, some of my subjects are refusing to pay their taxes."
Korra says: "I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ..."
Hou-Ting says: "That topiary is supposed to be an eel swan  not a turtle duck!"
