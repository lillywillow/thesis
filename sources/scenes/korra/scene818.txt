Tu says: "I've got them. These passports should get you into the Upper Ring."
Bolin says: "Awesome! Tu, you're the best cousin that I can have.  And my other cousins as well. Yeah. Yeah, you're all the best."
Mako says: "Thanks. I know this wasn't easy."
Yin says: "It's such a shame you two must leave so soon."
Mako says: "I wished we could stay. But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it."
Yin says: "I love you both. Come visit again."
Mako says: "We will, Grandma."
Bolin says: "I love you too, Grandma. And Chow, and Tu, and Meng-Meng, and Chow Jr., there is Big Tee and Little Tee, and Medium Yu, and ... and ... and what was your name again?"
