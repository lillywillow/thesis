Ikki says: "Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?"
Asami says: "Oh.  Uh, no. I wasn't completely aware of that."
Ikki says: "Hey!"
Korra says: "Run along, Ikki!"
Korra says: "So,  here's your room.  I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to."
Asami says: "I think it's really charming  and the best part about it, nothing here reminds me of my father.  Thank you for your hospitality."
Korra says: "Ikki! I swear  if you don't leave us alone, I'm gonna-  Uh, Tenzin!  Come right in."
Tenzin says: "Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island."
Asami says: "Thank you for having me."
Tenzin says: "Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later. I think we should both be there."
