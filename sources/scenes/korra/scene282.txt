Senna says: "Can't sleep again?  Honey, your father and I have tried to give you as much space as you've needed, but we're worried. Â You're not sleeping, you're barely eating. We don't want to push you, but it's been three weeks.  Will you please go see Katara?"
Korra says: "All right ... I'll go."
Senna says: "You're going to get through this.  I love you so much."
