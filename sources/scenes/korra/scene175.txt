Bolin says: "Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall! Man, have we got a lot of people hurt!  Is that everybody?! Gah!"
Tenzin says: "Kuvira is heading our way, with a platoon of mecha suits!"
Asami says: "What should we do?"
Bolin says: "This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing! Let her take the city for now! We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!"
Mako says: "What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out."
Korra says: "I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon."
Lin says: "I agree. We take down that giant today."
Korra says: "Lin!"
Lin says: "Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried."
Varrick says: "Well, you benders are going to have to fight her alone. She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits."
Asami says: "Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support."
Korra says: "Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own."
