Mako says: "What the heck did all this?"
Shopkeeper says: "It was my brother. He's out of control."
Mako says: "Okay, just tell me what happened."
Shopkeeper says: "We were arguing about the books, and Daw was yelling at me. And all of a sudden, things started flying around. He was creating this storm, like-"
Mako says: "Like what?"
Shopkeeper says: "Well, like he was airbending."
Mako says: "Sir, that's impossible. There are only five airbenders in the entire world, and, your brother is not one of them."
Shopkeeper says: "I know what I saw. He was freaking out yelling: "What's happening to me?!" Then, he ran into the back room and locked himself in."
Mako says: "Police. Open up."
Daw says: "Go away!"
Mako says: "Get out here, sir, or I'm knocking this door down. One, two--"
Daw says: "I'm so sorry!"
Shopkeeper says: "I told you. Airbending!"
