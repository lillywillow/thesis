Bailiff says: "Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict."
Sokka says: "In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities. Why, I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind.  Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police,  Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill. The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes. We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison."
Tenzin says: "Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice."
Lin says: "Chief."
Saikhan says: "Lin."
Tarrlok says: "Have you news of Avatar Korra?"
Tenzin says: "We do.  You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!"
Tarrlok says: "I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act! I already explained: Equalists attacked us and took her!"
Tenzin says: "But there were no chi blockers here last night.  You planted the evidence, didn't you?"
Tarrlok says: "That is a ridiculous accusation!"
Council page says: "It's true! He took her! I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave. I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage."
Tarrlok says: "Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again."
Tarrlok says: "That is nonsense!  Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!"
Lin says: "Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?"
Council page says: "I was terrified to tell because ...  Because Tarrlok is a bloodbender!  He bloodbent Avatar Korra!"
Tenzin says: "Don't make this worse for yourself.  Tell us where you have Korra."
