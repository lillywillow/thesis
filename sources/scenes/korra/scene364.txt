Guo says: "Wait! Leaving in the middle of a session could make you sick!"
Lin says: "I'm done here."
Korra says: "Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day?  You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night. Are you okay? You don't look good."
Lin says: "I'm fine!"
Lin says: "What did you do to me?"
Guo says: "I tried to warn you. Come with me. Let's go finish the session.  Just relax and breathe."
Lin says: "So, you're robbing stores with the Terra Triad now?"
Suyin says: "I didn't steal anything. I just drove the car. I owed my friends a favor. It's not a big deal."
Lin says: "I'm not letting you get away with this."
Suyin says: "Oh, what are you going to do, Officer? Arrest me?"
Lin says: "Don't even think about taking one more step!"
