Shiro Shinobi says: "Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes have reached a breaking point. After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising. But Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle. Enraged by the insurrection, Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him. Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?"
Korra says: "You're making a mistake."
Unalaq says: "I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home."
Korra says: "I can't believe you're doing this to your own family."
Unalaq says: "Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know."
Korra says: "Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you."
Unalaq says: "I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about."
Korra says: "I hope so."
