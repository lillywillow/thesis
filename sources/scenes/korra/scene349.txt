Toph says: "It's over! You're under arrest, Yakone!"
Yakone says: "What is Republic City coming to? Used to be, a man could enjoy his lunch in peace.  What's the big idea?"
Aang says: "We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are."
Toph says: "Take him away."
Yakone says: "I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me!  And I'll beat this one, too."
Korra says: "Whoa.  I finally connected with you, Aang.  But, what are you trying to tell me?  A way out of this box would be nice."
