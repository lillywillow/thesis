Amon says: "My quest for equality began many years ago.  When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich, and none of us were benders.  This made us very easy targets for the firebender who extorted my father.  One day, my father confronted this man, but when he did,  that firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face.  I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.  And if she were here,  she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But, she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world, is suffering. Â It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you have been wondering, "What is the Revelation?"  You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time,  the spirits have acted as guardians of our world, and they have spoken to me.  They say the Avatar has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power  that will make Equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away.  Permanently."
Korra says: "That's impossible.  There's no way."
Mako says: "This guy's insane!"
Amon says: "Now, for a demonstration. Please welcome, Lightning Bolt Zolt.  Leader of the Triple Threat Triad, and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City."
Lightning Bolt Zolt says: "Ah, boo yourself!"
Korra says: "There's Bolin."
Mako says: "Wait, we can't fight them all. We need to be smart about this."
Korra says: "Then come up with a game plan,  "Team Captain"."
Amon says: "Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing nonbenders.  But his reign of terror is about to come to an end.  Now, in the interest of fairness,  I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending."
Lightning Bolt Zolt says: "You're gonna regret doing that, pal."
