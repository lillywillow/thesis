Jinora says: "Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu? Dad wanted us to bring you back to Republic City."
Korra says: "If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back.  The world needs to know."
Meelo says: "Woo-hoo! Avatar fight! This is going to be awesome!"
Korra says: "Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight. Kuvira saved my dad. She was a captain in Su's guard; I think she can be reasoned with."
Meelo says: "What? No fight? Why did we go through all that trouble to save you if you're not going to beat someone up?"
