Tenzin says: "If anything goes wrong, come back immediately."
Jinora says: "I will."
Korra says: "What happened? What did you see?"
Jinora says: "The airbenders aren't there! It's completely deserted."
Tenzin says: "They're not down there?!"
Korra says: "Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?"
Jinora says: "I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the Upper Ring, or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring, or the maze of tunnels that connect the rings together, or they could beâ€”"
Tenzin says: "There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them."
Korra says: "Maybe there is.  How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?"
Jinora says: "I don't know. I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you."
Korra says: "Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection."
Tenzin says: "What do you mean "a connection"?"
Jinora says: "I don't know. Let me try."
Yung says: "Thanks."
Dai Li sergeant says: "You again?! If you have time to help your friend, then you're not getting enough rocks for yourself!"
Dai Li sergeant says: "I guess you're not as good as you thought."
Dai Li sergeant says: "Throw him in the hole!"
Kai says: "Jinora?"
Jinora says: "It worked!"
Kai says: "How are you here right now?"
Jinora says: "Shh, quiet. It's a high-level airbender move. With a little spiritual stuff thrown in."
Kai says: "At first, for a second there, I thought you were a ghost."
Jinora says: "It's good to see you. We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here. Where are we anyway?"
Kai says: "Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue."
Jinora says: "I'll figure it out. Don't worry."
Kai says: "Jinora!  Thanks."
Jinora says: "The Earth Queen's Temple!"
