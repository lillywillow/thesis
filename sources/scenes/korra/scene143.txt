Wan says: "You guys are hungry too, huh?"
Jaya says: "Wan, you should eat."
Wan says: "They need it more than I do.  Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps.  If only there was some way to get into the Chous' food cellar. We'd be eating like, well, like Chous."
Jaya says: "If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead. Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds."
Yao says: "No, don't get banished.  You don't want nothing to do with those spirits. They'll get inside ya, scramble up your mind, turn you into this , a monster!"
Jaya says: "Don't do anything crazy, Wan. You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. Some people have power. Some people don't. And you don't."
Wan says: "Not yet, anyway."
