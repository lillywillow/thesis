General says: "Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here in the hills outside of town."
Unalaq says: "Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. Increase security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority."
General says: "Yes, sir!"
Unalaq says: "I need you two to go after the Avatar. She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal."
Desna says: "But Father, you told Korra-"
Unalaq says: "I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear."
Eska says: "I'll find her.  She stole my husband."
Unalaq says: "I need her alive."
Eska says: "Fine."
