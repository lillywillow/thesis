Two Toed Ping says: "Hey, Mako. Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?"
Mako says: "Who hired you to double-cross us?"
Two Toed Ping says: "I don't know."
Mako says: "I think you do know.  And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to "No Toed Ping"."
Two Toed Ping says: "Really, I don't know. You have to believe me. We never met the guy who hired us."
Mako says: "You expect me to believe that?"
Two Toed Ping says: "After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted. We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since. Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work. Please, I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line."
Mako says: "Get out of here."
Mako says: "Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin!  Nuktuk."
Bolin says: "Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there."
Mako says: "Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something."
Bolin says: "Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy  "pyrotechnics". That's mover speak for explosions."
Assistant director says: "We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene."
Bolin says: "Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene."
