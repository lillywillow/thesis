Korra says: "Wait, Beifong? Lin Beifong?  You're Toph's daughter!"
Lin says: "What of it?"
Korra says: "Well then, why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends. They saved the world together."
Lin says: "That's ancient history.  And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now.  You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!"
Metalbending cop says: "Chief,  Councilman Tenzin is here."
Lin says: "Let him in."
Korra says: "Tenzin, sorry ...  I got a little sidetracked on my way to see you."
Tenzin says: "Lin, you are looking radiant as usual."
Lin says: "Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her."
Tenzin says: "My relocation has been delayed.  The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put."
Korra says: "Butâ€”"
Tenzin says: "If you would be so kind as to  drop the charges against Korra, I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events and cover all the damages."
