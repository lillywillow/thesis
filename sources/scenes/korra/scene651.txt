Tahno says: "Hey, Korra."
Korra says: "Tahno?"
Korra says: "Listen, I know we're not exactly best friends, but I'm sorry Amon took your bending."
Tahno says: "I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent.  You gotta get him for me."
Lin says: "Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know."
Hiroshi Sato says: "I'm happy to help any way I can. I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done."
Tenzin says: "We're ready for you now."
Tahno says: "See you around ...  "Ah"vatar."
Bolin says: "Earthbending bomb!"
Butler says: "Avatar Korra ... has arrived."
Mako says: "Hey, Korra!"
Asami says: "Glad you made it!"
Bolin says: "Welcome to paradise!"
Korra says: "Looks like you guys settled right in."
Mako says: "Pretty much,  except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here."
Asami says: "Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."
Bolin says: "This is the greatest place in the world! Watch this, watch this.  Fetch me my towel, good sir."
Butler says: "Yes, Master ... Bolin."
Bolin says: "Master Bolin! Ha, I love this guy.  Now pat me dry."
Butler says: "As you wish."
Bolin says: "Don't forget Master Pabu."
Butler says: "Wouldn't dream of it, sir."
Korra says: "So, what do you have planned for us today? Let me guess, shopping, makeovers ..."
Bolin says: "Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers!"
Asami says: "I had something a little more exciting in mind."
