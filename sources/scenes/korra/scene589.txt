Tenzin says: "Ikki! Ikki, where are you? Shoo!  Go bother someone else. You two are worse than Kya and Bumi."
Ikki says: "Okay, everybody here?"
Tenzin says: "Ikki! Oh, thank goodness."
Ikki says: "Juniper Lightning bug, paws off the table!  This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so ...  be quiet and listen up!  We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world.  But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here,  because they stink.  Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?"
Tenzin says: "Actually, is there room for one more?"
Ikki says: "Uh, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead."
Tenzin says: "Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead."
Ikki says: "And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters."
Tenzin says: "New ones, huh? Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?"
Ikki says: "Maybe, but only if they say it's okay.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. No, no, he's nice. They say it's okay."
Bolin says: "We're good to go. I gave all the money to some guys over there. I told them to "take care of it", and then I winked.  Pretty sure they got the message."
