Jinora says: "Korra! The vines! They're taking me! Help!"
Lin says: "Get everyone out of here. Put up a perimeter. Cancel all tours. Somebody get a hold of Tenzin."
Korra says: "We gotta get in there and find Jinora."
Lin says: "I don't think anyone should be going in there right now."
Korra says: "I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can do this."
Lin says: "Be careful."
