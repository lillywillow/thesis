Korra says: "Woohoo!  Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people?  We should be celebrating!  Three elements down,  one to go!"
Firebending master says: "You're getting ahead of yourself as usual, Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet."
White Lotus leader says: "Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side.  The Avatar must master both."
Korra says: "I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me.  But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately.  He's Mister Spiritual."
