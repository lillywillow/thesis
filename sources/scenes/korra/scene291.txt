Korra says: "Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say.  The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State. I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day.  Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.  Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.  I don't think they'd understand."
