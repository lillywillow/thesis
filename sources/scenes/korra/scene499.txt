Opal says: "Thanks for making my favorite meal."
Chef says: "I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do."
Bolin says: "Every time I eat raw kale, I'm going to think of you."
Opal says: "You're so sweet."
Bolin says: "This stinks! We were just starting to get to know each other, and now you're off to the Northern Air Temple."
Opal says: "We'll be together soon. You guys are coming up after finding more airbenders, right?"
Bolin says: "Yeah, but that's ... in the future. Ugh, I hate the future!"
Opal says: "Until then, we'll always have kale."
Varrick says: "Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?"
Bolin says: "Umm, no."
Varrick says: "Well, your loss.  Zhu Li!  bring the, uh, thing.  Check out my latest invention:  an airbender finder."
Korra says: "Wait, that can find airbenders?"
Asami says: "Uh ...  I think  it's broken."
Varrick says: "It's not broken. She needs to  airbend into it!  How else do you expect the thing to work?"
Mako says: "What's going on? I can't hear anything. I hate sitting down here!  Uh, not because of you."
Aiwei says: "I can tell you're lying."
Suyin says: "Everyone, if I could have your attention please? Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple.  Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend,  and soon to be  airbending master.  Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era!"
