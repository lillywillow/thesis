Mako says: "What kind of game are you playing?"
Korra says: "Uh ... Pro-bending? We've got the quarterfinal match."
Mako says: "No, I mean with Bolin. You've got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me."
Korra says: "I am not, we're just having fun together. What do you care, anyway?"
Mako says: "I'm looking out for my little brother. I don't want to see his heart get broken."
Korra says: "Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous! You do have feelings for me!"
Mako says: "What? Jealous? Don't be ridiculous."
Korra says: "Admit it! You like me."
Mako says: "No, I'm with Asami."
Korra says: "Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?"
Mako says: "Get over yourself!"
Korra says: "I'm just being honest."
Mako says: "You're crazy!"
Korra says: "You're a liar!"
Random stranger says: "Hey Mako-! Oh ..."
