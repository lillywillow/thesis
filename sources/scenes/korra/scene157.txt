Huntsman says: "And the way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen.  He uses it like it's an extension of his body."
Jaya says: "Wan has proved that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds.  We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore, so I say we leave this city and start over.  Who's with me?"
Wan says: "You ready to go, Mula?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "You sure you want to leave?"
Wan says: "Yes. It's time I see the rest of the world and find the other lion turtle cities."
Aye-aye spirit says: "I'm proud to call you my friend, Stinky."
Wan says: "Thank you for everything.  Goodbye, everyone."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "We'll miss you."
