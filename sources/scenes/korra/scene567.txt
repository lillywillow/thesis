Protester says: "Equality now! Equality now!  We want equality now!"
Korra says: "I-I ... er ... eheh, humn, hmmehem."
Protester says: "Nonbenders of Republic City ..."
Korra says: "That's the guy."
Protester says: "Amon calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the ...  It's you again!  You cannot silence me, Avatar!"
Korra says: "Shut your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi blockers. Where'd they take him?"
Protester says: "I have no idea what you're talking about."
Korra says: "Oh, I think you do."
Mako says: ""Witness the Revelation tonight, nine o' clock".  What's this "Revelation"?"
Protester says: "Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!"
Korra says: "You better believe it concerns us. Spill it."
Protester says: "No one knows what the Revelation is! And I have no idea what happened to your friend.  But if he's a bender, then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him."
Mako says: "Where's it happening?"
Policeman says: "Hey! What's going on over there?"
Protester says: "The Avatar's oppressing us. Help!"
Korra says: "Let's scram."
Korra says: "Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?"
Mako says: "Probably because they don't want just anyone waltzing in to their big  "Revelation",  whatever that is.  I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs.  There's four different images."
Korra says: "So,  it's a puzzle?"
Mako says: "Yeah, of a map!"
Mako says: "Bingo.  That must be where it's going down."
