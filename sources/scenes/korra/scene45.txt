Ryu's mother says: "Oh, are you the Avatar? When my son got airbending, my husband and I were so happy. We thought this could open a lot of doors for him, maybe he could finally move out of the basement."
Korra says: "How old is he?"
Ryu's mother says: "He's twenty-two, and you know, still just to figuring his life out."
Korra says: "Well, I have a great opportunity for him. We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple."
Ryu's mother says: "Ah, that sounds wonderful! I'll get him.  Ryu! Get up here!"
Korra says: "Hi, I'm Korra."
Ryu says: "So you're like the Avatar or something. Big deal."
Korra says: "Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity."
Ryu says: "Yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested."
Korra says: "Well, you're gonna be interested."
Korra says: "You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world."
Ryu says: "Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know."
Korra says: "Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties."
Ryu says: "So? You don't have to."
Korra says: "Yes, I do have to."
Ryu says: "No, you don't."
Korra says: "Yes, I do!"
Ryu says: "No, you don't."
Korra says: "Well,  if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that! Is that what you want?"
Ryu says: "Maybe."
Korra says: "No, it's not!"
Ryu says: "So what? Who cares?"
Korra says: "Everyone cares!"
Ryu says: "I don't care."
Korra says: "Yes, you do!"
Ryu says: "No, I don't."
Korra says: "Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me!"
Ryu says: "Stop pulling on my collar! You're stretching it out! Mom, are you just gonna let her take me?!"
Ryu's mother says: "I think it's a great opportunity. Just try it for a week and see how it goes."
Ryu says: "No! Let me go!"
Korra says: "That's it!"
Mako says: "Korra, enough! Let's get out of here!"
Bolin says: "So nice to meet you! Good luck with your son!"
White Lotus sentry #1 says: "We're under attack!"
White Lotus sentry #2 says: "Look out!"
Ming-Hua says: "I never thought I'd be so happy to see your ugly mugs again."
Ghazan says: "Great to see you too, Ming-Hua."
Ming-Hua says: "I'm flattered. You busted me out before that girlfriend of yours."
Zaheer says: "We're getting her next."
