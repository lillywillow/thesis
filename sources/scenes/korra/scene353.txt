Officer says: "Chief Beifong?"
Lin says: "I'm too late. That monster already took your bending, didn't he?"
Lin says: "I'm so sorry.  Come on, let's gets you out of here."
Mako says: "I'll ask you one more time;  where is she?"
Equalist says: "We don't have the Avatar, and the Equalists didn't attack City Hall. Tarrlok's lying."
Mako says: "What?"
Lin says: "I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here."
Mako says: "Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?"
Tenzin says: "Because he has Korra. He fooled us all!"
Bolin says: "Let's go, people!"
Bolin says: "Try to chi block that, fools!"
Lin says: "We've got more company!  Hang on!"
Prosecution attorney says: "Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years. Yet he has always managed to stay out of the law's reach, until now. You will hear testimony, from dozens of his victims, and they will tell you, Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld by using an ability that has been illegal for decades.  Bloodbending."
Defense attorney says: "The prosecution's entire case is built upon the make-believe notion that my client is able to bloodbend at will, at any time on any day. I remind the council that bloodbending is an incredibly rare skill and it can only be performed during a full moon.  Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client used bloodbending at every other time except during a full moon. It would be a mockery of justice to convict a man of a crime that is impossible to commit."
