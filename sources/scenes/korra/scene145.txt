Wan says: "The lion turtle."
Huntsman says: "Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire."
Lion turtle says: "The power is yours to keep until your return."
Huntsman says: "You're first, kid."
Lion turtle says: "May the element of fire protect you against the spirits."
Huntsman says: "Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?"
Wan says: "Sure thing."
Huntsman says: "Everyone, stay close. Spirits love to pick off stragglers."
Wan says: "Uh, guys?  I don't think I can do this."
Huntsman says: "Now, quit your whining. We haven't even seen a spirit yet."
Wan says: "I think I wanna go home."
Huntsman says: "I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the lion turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again."
