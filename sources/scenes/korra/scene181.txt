Bolin says: "Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Because it's powered with spirit vine energy. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you, but it's unstoppable."
Hiroshi says: "It's not."
Asami says: "Dad?"
Lin says: "I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in."
Hiroshi says: "I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City and I would do anything to save her."
Korra says: "You think you know how to defeat this thing?"
Hiroshi says: "You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack its vital organs, disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live."
Korra says: "But how are we supposed to get inside?"
Hiroshi says: "Future Industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha suit ..."
Asami says: "But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground."
Hiroshi says: "I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in."
Asami says: "Like a metal mosquito."
Varrick says: "You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!"
Korra says: "We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope."
