Amon says: "It is time for you to be equalized."
Tarrlok says: "You fool! You've never faced bending like mine."
Tarrlok says: "What? What are you?"
Amon says: "I am the solution."
Amon says: "I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the Avatar. Do not underestimate her. Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it."
Lieutenant says: "My pleasure."
Lieutenant says: "It's payback time."
Lieutenant says: "Open the box.  Tie her up."
Amon says: "I thought I told you not to underestimate her."
Korra says: "Naga. You came looking for me.  Good girl."
Mako says: "That sounds like Naga!  Down there!"

Mako says: "Give her some space!  I was so worried. Are you all right?"
Korra says: "I'm fine. I'm glad you're here."

Suyin and her daughter welcomed Lin with open arms, but she wanted nothing to do with them. Meanwhile, Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island, looking for the Avatar. After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City."
