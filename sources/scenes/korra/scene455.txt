Korra says: "Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh."
Iroh says: "What can I do?"
Korra says: "The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order. So I decided to come to you directly."
Iroh says: "I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to accidentally run into a hostile Northern blockade. We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?"
Korra says: "I guess you wouldn't. Thank you!"
Raiko says: "Swapping old war stories?"
Iroh says: "Mr. President."
Raiko says: "I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your commander-in-chief?"
Iroh says: "Of course not, sir."
Raiko says: "Good. Because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed. Am I clear?"
Iroh says: "Crystal, sir."
Raiko says: "Your activities here are bordering on insurrection. The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic. Don't go behind my back again.  As you were, General Iroh."
Korra says: "I hate that guy!"
Iroh says: "I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied."
Korra says: "I understand. Thanks anyway."
Iroh says: "But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help."
Korra says: "Thank you, General."
