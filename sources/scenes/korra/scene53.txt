Bolin says: "Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako."
Korra says: "Mako? Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!"
Mako says: "Come on, Bolin, we're up."
Wu says: "Whoa! That was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy!"
Mako says: "You know what else is rude? Interrupting.  Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender  and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists.  After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection."
Wu says: "So then you smooched her real good, eh?"
Mako says: "Not exactly."
