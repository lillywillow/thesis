Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Korra Kya Mako Tenzin Antagonists Dark spirits Desna and Eska Unalaq Vaatu says: "Minor Katara Naga Oogi Pabu Senna Tonraq"
Shiro Shinobi says: "After ten thousand years, Harmonic Convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free. Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit. Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety. So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar."
Vaatu says: "Raava,  nothing could stop this moment. Harmonic Convergence is upon us again."
Korra says: "I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq. You're going right back in that prison."
Korra says: "Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World."
Bolin says: "We're on it."
Bumi says: "Jinora. Jinora's spirit do you hear me?  It's your Uncle Bumi."
Tenzin says: "Ah, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her."
Bumi says: "We just need to employ the simply rules of tracking.  First we locate her footprints ... then we follow them."
Kya says: "Do you even know what spirit footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the Spirit World.  Let me try something.  Jinora is over there.  I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction."
Bumi says: "We're in the Spirit World. There's spiritual energy in every direction."
Tenzin says: "Enough!  We can't do this by ourselves. We need a spirit guide."
Tenzin says: "There.  Spirit, hello.  I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance."
Dark Spider Spirit says: "You dare wake me, human? Humans in the Spirit World belong in one place only."
Bumi says: "Well, that didn't work. Now where are we?"
Tenzin says: "We're completely lost."
