Bumi says: "You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se."
Tenzin says: "Here we go."
Bumi says: "For five days we scoured the beast of a mountain, fighting our ways through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety."
Tenzin says: "And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?"
Bumi says: "It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you."
Tenzin says: "I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. Three typhoons?"
Bumi says: "Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-"
Kya says: "Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints."
Tenzin says: "Come on!"
Bumi says: "No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster."
Kya says: "Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're going to hurt yourself."
Bumi says: "Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders."
Kya says: "Fine."
Kya says: "You were right, Bumi! That was faster!"
Tenzin says: "At least fifty times faster, by my calculations."
Bumi says: "Oh, so Tenzin's the funny guy now."
Tenzin says: "If you need an airlift down, just say the word."
Bumi says: "Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control.  Agh!"
Tenzin says: "Bumi!"
