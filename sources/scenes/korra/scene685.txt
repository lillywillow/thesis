Bolin says: "I don't know if we can win this fight."
Mako says: "We don't need to win, we just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World."
Tenzin says: "We're walking in circles,  I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times."
Bumi says: "That's not the same mushroom."
Spirit mushroom says: "Yes I am."
Tenzin says: "See? Even it knows we're lost."
Bumi says: "Oh sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother."
Kya says: "What's that?"
Bumi says: "Mushroom? Is that you?"
Spirit mushroom says: "No, wasn't me."
Bumi says: "Iroh?!"
Tenzin says: "How ...? Where ...? It's been so long."
Iroh says: "Almost forty years. It's nice to see you again."
Tenzin says: "How did you know we were here?"
Iroh says: "My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost, I came to show you the way out."
Tenzin says: "Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out. We're looking for my daughter."
Iroh says: "I'm sorry to hear that. But you shouldn't be here, Vaatu has escaped and darkness threatens to take over."
Tenzin says: "I'm not leaving until I find Jinora."
Iroh says: "I understand. But I beg you to be careful, if you travel too deep into the Spirit World, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you."
Tenzin says: "A place where only the lost can find you ...? That's it! I know where to find Jinora!"
