Raiko says: "Thank you both for coming."
Varrick says: "It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms."
Raiko says: "Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you. Especially after you tried to have me kidnapped."
Varrick says: "Allegedly."
Asami says: "Right. Everything you do is "allegedly". Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!"
Varrick says: "I own that building! A man has a right to blow up his own property!"
Raiko says: "Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon, we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it."
Varrick says: "What do you say, Asami?  Partners again?"
Asami says: "Fine. I'll help.  But don't even think about double-crossing me again."
