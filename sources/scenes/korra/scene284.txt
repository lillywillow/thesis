Katara says: "I can help guide your healing process,  but whether you get better or not,  is up to you."
Katara says: "I know what it's like to go through a traumatic experience.  And I promise you, if you dedicate yourself to getting better, you'll recover,  stronger than ever."
Korra says: "That's what I want.  More than anything!"
Katara says: "Then try something for me. Concentrate  on your big toe.  Visualize it moving.  Breathe."
Korra says: "Did you see that?  It worked!"
