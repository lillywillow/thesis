Bolin says: "Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today. That guy is a genius."
Mako says: "Uh-huh."
Bolin says: "He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing."
Mako says: "What? That's a terrible idea!"
Bolin says: "And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk!  He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold. He was born in the tundra."
Mako says: "Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here."
Bolin says: "Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, sure. What is it?"
Mako says: "Something doesn't make sense about this bombing. I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.  Wait a second! That's him! That's the guy that attacked the center! I gotta go show this to Beifong!"
Bolin says: "Glad I could help. Nuktuk saves the day again!"
