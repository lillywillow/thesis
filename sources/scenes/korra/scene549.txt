Jinora says: "I will make no such promises."
Korra says: "I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already."
Bolin says: "We might as well have."
Mako says: "Hasook's a no-good no-show!"
Referee says: "You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified."
Mako says: "Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings."
Korra says: "Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?"
Bolin says: "Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team."
Korra says: "Well, then ...  how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender,  if I do say so myself."
Bolin says: "But, you're the Avatar.  Isn't that cheating?"
Korra says: "It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending."
Mako says: "No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there."
Korra says: "Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence."
Referee says: "Time's up. You in or out?"
Korra says: "We're in!"
Mako says: "We are?"
Bolin says: "Yes!"
Mako says: "Hey, I didn't agree to this!"
Korra says: "You can thank me later."
Mako says: "This girl is crazy."
