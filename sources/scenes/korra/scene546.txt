Bolin says: "That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted!  Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ...  pop, pop!"
Korra says: "Okay, let me try it again."
Bolin says: "Wow! Nice adjustment!  You're a natural at this."
Mako says: "Not bad."
Korra says: "What's it take to impress this guy?"
Mako says: "What? I said "not bad".  You know what, it's getting late.  I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra."
Korra says: "Yeah, been a real pleasure."
Mako says: "See ya upstairs, bro."
Korra says: "Upstairs?  You guys live here?"
Bolin says: "Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views!  So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?"
