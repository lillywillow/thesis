Korra says: "How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?"
Korra says: "Ugh, I don't get it. I can vanquish Vaatu but not a bunch of stupid vines?"
Tenzin says: "I'm sure you'll find a way."
Jinora says: "Why do you want to get rid of them? You changed the world. We're connected with the spirits again. The wilds are their home."
Korra says: "I don't think that the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are."
Korra says: "I gotta go face the press and tell them I still don't have a way to get rid of the vines.  This should be fun."
