Korra says: "Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!"
Varrick says: "I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go."
Mako says: "What happened?"
Korra says: "I found out the truth about my dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them."
Mako says: "Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup."
Korra says: "Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help."
Mako says: "If you do this, there's no going back."
Korra says: "I know. Will you help me or not?"
Mako says: "Of course, I'll help."
Asami says: "Me too."
Varrick says: "Count me in!"
Mako says: "I don't even want to know."
Asami says: "So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?"
Bolin says: "No, no, the honesty thing worked out great. So great she decided we should  get married!"
Asami says: "Sorry."
Korra says: "I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace."
Bolin says: "I guess Eska didn't get the memo."
Varrick says: "Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now, gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan."
