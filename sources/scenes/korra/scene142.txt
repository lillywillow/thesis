Little Chou says: "Nobody steals from the Chou brothers!"
Wan says: "Really? Because I just did."
Big Chou says: "You're dead, Wan."
Wan says: "Actually, I feel quite alive."
Little Chou says: "Hey, stop!"
Wan says: "He-he-hey, fellas!  You're just in time for lunch!"
Little Chou says: "I told you no one steals from us."
Jaya says: "Did you steal from the Chous again?"
Wan says: "Yeah, and I got to nothing show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises.  Hey, Yao, I got some food for you."
Yao says: "Mmm. Delicious!  Thank you, Wan."
