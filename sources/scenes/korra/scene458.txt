Korra says: "You ratted me out to the President?"
Mako says: "Korra, let me explain."
Korra says: "Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?"
Mako says: "Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question. What was I supposed to do?"
Korra says: "You betrayed me, and my family!"
Mako says: "Enough! Look, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake!"
Korra says: "Well, I have a job to do too, only it seems like you're always standing in the way of me getting it done!"
Mako says: "Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!"
Korra says: "So, what? Are you breaking up with me?"
Mako says: "Yeah. I guess I am."
Lin says: "What the flameo happened here?!"
Mako says: "I broke up with the Avatar."
Lin says: "You got off easy. You shoulda seen Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me!"
