Bolin says: "Hey, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash."
Mako says: "Is this a marble statue of you?"
Bolin says: "It's also  a hat rack."
Mako says: "We don't even have hats."
Bolin says: "That's because we never had a hat rack. And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip."
Mako says: "I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help."
Bolin says: "You need my help?  I don't know. I'm kinda busy."
Mako says: "You're sitting in a hot tub."
Bolin says: "I'm maintaining my instrument. As an actor, my body is my instrument."
Mako says: "Are you gonna help or not?"
Bolin says: "You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life."
Mako says: "So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?"
Bolin says: "I don't know, Mako.  Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it?  Ow! My instrument!"
