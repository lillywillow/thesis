Suyin says: "You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world."
Korra says: "It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?"
Suyin says: "It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths."
Korra says: "That sounds like a good thing."
Suyin says: "And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home."
Korra says: "It sounds like you've created the perfect life here."
Suyin says: "Almost. I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around."
Bolin says: "Hey, lady. Wow, you really blowin' me away with yourÂ airbending.  Ahhh, woo-woosh, psst."
Opal says: "Why are you acting weird?"
Bolin says: "Why are you acting weird?"
Opal says: "I don't like how you're talking to me."
Bolin says: "Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid."
Opal says: "Who said I liked you?"
Bolin says: "Oh no. But I though ... Mako said-"
Opal says: "Just kidding. But, do me a favor and stop trying.  Look, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself."
Bolin says: "Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I can give that a shot."
Opal says: "Oh, hey Korra."
Korra says: "Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need you help with something."
Zaheer says: ""Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind.""
Ikki says: "What are you doing? No one's allowed in Daddy's study except Daddy."
Zaheer says: "I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep."
Ikki says: "What were you reading?"
Zaheer says: "A poem by Guru Laghima, the wisest airbender who ever lived."
Kya says: "Ikki, you should be in bed. C'mon."
Ikki says: "Night."
Zaheer says: "Good night."
Kya says: "You seem to know a lot about airbender history for someone who just got airbending."
Zaheer says: "I've always admired the culture."
Kya says: "And you moved through those gates like a natural. Where did you say you were from?"
Zaheer says: "A small village up north. You've probably never heard of it."
Kya says: "Wait.  Zaheer!"
Kya says: "I need some help!"
White Lotus sentry says: "Hold it right there!"
Zaheer says: "Sorry, I won't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans."
Lin says: "Who is it?"
Korra says: "Hey, it's me. I brought someone who wants to talk to you."
Lin says: "You want to talk? Then talk."
Opal says: "I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you. When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad you didn't want to know me.  Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming some times. But I would love it so much if you would be a part of it."
Lin says: "Get out."
Opal says: "Sorry, did I say something wrong?"
Lin says: "Get out!"
Korra says: "What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal. I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. But I guess I was wrong."
Lin says: "Why don't you focus on fixing the world, and stop trying to fix my family?"
Korra says: "Su's right. You're never going to change. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman."

In a last-ditch effort, Asami and her father outfitted the hummingbird suits with platinum cutters. Hiroshi helped Team Avatar infiltrate the mecha giant, but he paid the ultimate price!
