Mako says: "If you think  holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed."
Ming-Hua says: "Can't we just enjoy our time together in silence?"
Mako says: "And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed. Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?"
Ghazan says: "Look, all you need to know is that the world is about to change, for the better."
Bolin says: "So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, huh? It must've been like crazy boring."
Ghazan says: "Actually, it was only thirteen years. But it felt like thirty."
Bolin says: "I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?"
Ming-Hua says: "Not a lot of craft supplies in a volcanic prison cell."
Ghazan says: "And I must've renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event."
Ming-Hua says: "I would've killed for some rain. Mostly I just made up stories about the guards: who was having trouble with his girlfriend; which one secretly wished he'd become a pastry chef."
Bolin says: "Ooh okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys.  You were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two."
Ghazan says: "Two out of three. Not bad."
Mako says: "Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?"
Bolin says: "Sorry!"
Zaheer says: "Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there."
