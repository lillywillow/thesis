Tenzin says: "Well done kids!  I'm proud of you all for finding Korra."
Meelo says: "Proud enough to get me my tats?"
Tenzin says: "No."
Tenzin says: "Welcome home."
Korra says: "I missed you, Tenzin."
Tenzin says: "Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu."
Bumi says: "Way to ruin the moment."
Opal says: "Kuvira's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers."
Korra says: "I thought I was strong enough to stop her. I feel like such a failure."
Tenzin says: "No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her.  We're just glad to have you back."
Bumi says: "Where's Bolin? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?"
Opal says: "I can't believe he would stay with her after what she did to my family. But we don't know where he is."
