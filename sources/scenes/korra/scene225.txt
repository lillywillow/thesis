Bolin says: "That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running. Don't make eye contact."
Bolin says: "Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude."
Tahno says: "Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Avatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons."
Korra says: "You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?"
Tahno says: "Go for it. I'll give you the first shot."
Bolin says: "Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you. If you hit him, we're out of the tournament."
Bolin says: "Whoa, ho, ho, I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that. You are one of a kind, Korra."
