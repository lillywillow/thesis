Bolin says: "Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable."
Varrick says: "This is no time for thinking, kid! We're heading into the big finale!  Bolin gathers his airbender army to fight alongside Rotan and Juji against the Terror Square!  Maybe that's the name of the bad guys, "Terror Square"!  What about "Legion of Darkness"? Well, we'll put a focus group on it.  Bolin teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado.  Then he flies around in the sky,  pushes Zaheer into it,  turning him into wind, forever! But Bolin doesn't realize that the Universal Interplanetary Combination Zero-Hour—talk about a ticking clock—is almost upon him!  And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the evil Unalaq,  the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway!  They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free,  and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant!  But when Vaatu is set free, the evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one horrifying monster!  Giant Bolin and the evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City!  It looks like the evil UnaVaatu might win!  But thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo is so strong that he attracts the queen of the fairies!  With her help, Bolin turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky.  And that's where the stars come from.  Oh yeah, and he turns into a dragon and he goes into the Spirit World and he saves the Avatar.  The end!"
Bolin says: "Wait! You like that?  It didn't make any sense! What about Zombie Amon? What happened to him, huh? And-and-and-and stars are magic fairy dust?  Are you guys crazy?  Are you crazy?"
Baraz says: "It's just a mover.  Don't over-think it. It's like a ride."
Varrick says: "Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, kid!"
