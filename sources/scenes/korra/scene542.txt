Bolin says: "Whaddya think? Best seats in the house, huh?"
Korra says: "Whoa! Unbelievable!  This place is even more amazing than I imagined!"
Bolin says: "Name's Bolin, by the way."
Korra says: "Korra."
Mako says: "Psst,  Bolin."
Bolin says: "Yeah?"
Mako says: "I told you, you have to stop bringing your crazy fangirls in here before the matches. Get her out of here."
Bolin says: "Come on, Mako! Right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay,  but man, I got a good feeling, there's somethin' special about her. I know it!  Come here, I want you to meet my brother, Mako."
Korra says: "Mako? Wow, I-I heard you playing on the radio."
Mako says: "Come on, Bolin, we're up."
Korra says: "... or I could meet him later."
Bolin says: "Yeah, sorry about that. My brother just gets real ... focused before a match.  Okay, I gotta go, wish me luck.  Not ... that I'll need it."
Korra says: "Good luck.  Knock 'em out!"
