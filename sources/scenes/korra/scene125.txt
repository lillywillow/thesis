Baatar Jr. says: "All right, everybody, let's test the power core.  I want everything in order for the full demonstration for Kuvira tomorrow. Load the energy capsule."
Baatar Jr. says: "Zhu Li, initialize phase one."
Zhu Li says: "There's a problem with the condenser. It's backing up!"
Baatar Jr. says: "Shut it down."
Zhu Li says: "I can't. The override isn't working. Everyone needs to evacuate. This thing is going to blow!"
Baatar Jr. says: "Everyone get out! Now!"
Zhu Li says: "Come on, Baatar! It's too late!"
Baatar Jr. says: "This channeling ring was cracked. That's what caused the reaction to overload.  Now we're taking this whole thing apart tonight and checking everything! Nothing is too small. This has to be ready by tomorrow."
