Aiwei says: "That statue honors the first metalbender, Toph Beifong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, everyone is encouraged to reach his, or her, highest potential."
Bolin says: "Does Toph live here? Are we going to get to meet her?"
Aiwei says: "I'm afraid not.  She would visit from time to time, but years ago she left to wander the world, in search of enlightenment.  No one has seen her since."
Korra says: "Wow. Is this where the airbender lives?"
Aiwei says: "Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you."
