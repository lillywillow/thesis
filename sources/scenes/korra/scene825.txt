Tenzin says: "Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders.  You three, find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong."
Yung says: "What's going on? Who are you?"
Korra says: "I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here."
Tenzin says: "Everyone, please! You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work."
Yung says: "What to work?  We're sneaking out?"
Korra says: "Yes, and we must leave now."
Tenzin says: "We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city."
Yung says: "There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him."
Tenzin says: "We're already taking care of it."
Bumi says: "Topside, this is Papa Bear. The breezies are in the hold; cue the balloons!"
Lin says: "What? Are you in trouble?"
Bumi says: "No! We've got the airbenders and we're headed out!  No one likes code names anymore."
Lin says: "Copy that. Asami and I are on our way."
Mako says: "Come on. We're getting you out."
Jinora says: "Kai!"
Bolin says: "Whoa! Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!"
Mako says: "Then don't tell him."
Bolin says: "How can I not? This is too juicy!"
Kai says: "Thanks for coming to get me. I'm really sorry about stealing your wallets, and running away, and getting you stuck on that train."
Bolin says: "We can't stay mad at you."
Mako says: "Yes, we can! I had a lot of money in that wallet!"
Jinora says: "Guys, come on!"
Dai Li sergeant says: "Deserting Her Majesty's army is high treason. Punishable by death!"
