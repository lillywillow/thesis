Jinora says: "So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending a lot of time together lately."
Ikki says: "Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance."
Korra says: "What?  Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff.  Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I am interested in him. What would I do?"
Jinora says: "Ooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did!"
Korra says: "Tell me!"
Jinora says: "She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country.  Then she jumped into a volcano. It was so romantic!"
Korra says: "Uhh ..."
Ikki says: "No, no, no!  The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch. Forever and ever and ever!"
Korra says: "The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now."
Korra says: "Oh, hey Pema. Uh, how long were you standing there?"
Pema says: "Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact the same situation, with Tenzin."
Ikki says: "Daddy was in love with someone else before you?"
Pema says: "That's right."
Korra says: "So what did you do?"
Pema says: "Well, for the longest time, I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history."
Korra, Ikki, and Jinora says: "Wooow!"
