Tarrlok says: "A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon.  We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it.  I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals. My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power.  He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen."
Yakone says: "That's the way it's done. That's what you need to strive for."
Tarrlok says: "Even though Noatak was my father's favorite, it wasn't any easier for him. He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands.  Something changed in Noatak over the years;  the loving brother I once knew became cold and detached.  Our father pushed us to extremes, and one day, he made us bloodbend each other."
Yakone says: "Noatak, go!  Excellent.  Tarrlok, your turn."
Tarrlok says: "No.  I won't do it."
Yakone says: "Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok!"
Tarrlok says: "That felt awful. I don't want to do that to anyone. I never want to bloodbend again."
Yakone says: "You're a disgrace, a weakling. I'll teach you a lesson, you insubordinate-"
Noatak says: "Stay away from him."
Yakone says: "How dare you bloodbend me!"
Noatak says: "What're you gonna do about it? You're the weak one.  You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your bending away. What could be more powerful than that?"
Yakone says: "I made you what you are. You're mine."
Noatak says: "We're your sons,  not your tools of revenge.  Let's go. We can run away from him.  Forever."
Tarrlok says: "Run away? But what about Mom? We can't just leave her."
Noatak says: "He was right about you. You are a weakling."
Tarrlok says: "Noatak! Don't leave! Please! Noatak!"
