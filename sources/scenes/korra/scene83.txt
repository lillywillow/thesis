Shiro Shinobi says: "The Ferret brothers are backed up to zone three and the Wolfbats smell blood.  Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move but once again there's no call.  I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one.  Oh ... a splash-and-clash sends the Avatar to zone three as well.  It's a knockout! The Wolfbats win the championship for the fourth year in a-  Hold on a second, folks!  Scratch that! The Ferrets are still alive, but just barely.  What an unbelievable move! These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind!  The underdogs survive to see round two."
Korra says: "What's wrong with these refs?"
Mako says: "They've been paid off; it's the only explanation.  Someone wants us to lose."
Korra says: "If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty,  then so should we."
Mako says: "No we can't!  The refs have it out for us. If we're gonna win this thing, it has to be fair and square."
Korra says: "Argh, that's no fun but ... all right."
Ring announcer says: "Round two!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "The opening salvo is a brutal call as both sides give it their all.  But once again, Tahno sneaks in a little ice to get the upper hand.  Wowzers! Those look like illegal head shots to me!"
Ring announcer says: "Round two will be decided with a tie-breaker!"
