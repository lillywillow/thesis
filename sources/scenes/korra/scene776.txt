Lin says: "Let's see.  Multiple counts of destruction of private and city property,  not to mention evading arrest ...  You're in a whole mess of trouble, young lady."
Korra says: "But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shopkeeper, and I had it ..."
Lin says: "Can it!  You should have called the police and stayed out of the way."
Korra says: "But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people.  See, I'm the Avatar."
Lin says: "Oh, I am well aware of who you are.  And your Avatar title might impress some people,  but not me."
Korra says: "All right, fine.  Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge."
Lin says: "You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong."
