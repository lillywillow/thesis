Bolin says: "Hello? Anyone? Nuktuk's still up here, all alone.  Asami! Hey, what are you doing here?"
Asami says: "Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming.  Are you filming right now?"
Bolin says: "Right now? Nope. We're uh ... we're at lunch."
Mako says: "Asami, there you are. Is Bolin around?"
Bolin says: "Up here."
Mako says: "Good. I've got something to tell you both."
Bolin says: "Ahh! Ow, aww. Oh, I got to stop doing my own stunts."
Mako says: "I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries:  Varrick."
Bolin says: "What? No."
Asami says: "He attacked his own ship?"
Mako says: "Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries."
Asami says: "Varrick helped save Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind.  Mako, you seemed stressed."
Mako says: "I am stressed!"
Bolin says: "See, this is why I had to move out."
Asami says: "You guys aren't living together anymore?"
Bolin says: "Nope. It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly."
Asami says: "Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.  Maybe you just need to relax."
Bolin says: "Wait a minute. Are you twoâ€”  you're dating again? What?"
Mako says: "Dating? No!"
Asami says: "That's crazy!"
Bolin says: "Korra just left a week ago!"
Mako says: "Guys, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack.  And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?"
Asami says: "Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators."
Bolin says: "Yeah. Let it go, Mako.  Let it go."
Mako says: "Gah! No! I'm not going to let it go!"
Bodyguard says: "Varrick's been looking for you."
