Tonraq says: "Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling."
Varrick says: "Troubling? Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away, and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking.  Nay, sickening! But these kale cookies? Opposite.  Remind me to get the recipe later."
Tonraq says: "What's your point, Varrick?"
Varrick says: "My point is,  Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies  we can eat?"
Zhu Li says: "Probably a couple of days."
Varrick says: "Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up.  Not to mention, I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting thanks to this harbor lockdown?  Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish?  Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish."
Korra says: "Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking."
Varrick says: "The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independence. Am I right, people?"
Korra says: "All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again."
Varrick says: "No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom!"
Korra says: "You want to start a war? Are you crazy?"
Tonraq says: "Unalaq started this, not us.  I'm sorry, maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?"
Korra says: "I'll do it for the tribe."
Varrick says: "I cannot stop eating these things.  Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war."
