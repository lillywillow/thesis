Tenzin says: "The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about that in ancient text. The fog is actually a spirit  that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories."

Zhao says: "I am Zhao the Conqueror.  I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar.  I am Zhao the Conqueror.  I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar."
Kya says: "Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy."
Zhao says: "You, you're him. The last airbender!"
Tenzin says: "Ah, no! Get off me!"
Zhao says: "You've grown. But I will still defeat you.  Come back Avatar. Face me! I am Zhao the Conqueror. I will capture you! Victory will be mine!"
Tenzin says: "If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog."
