Bolin says: "Where are you going?"
Opal says: "We've got some family business to take care of."
Bolin says: "All right, listen. Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ... I love you."
Opal says: "Thanks for saying all of that.  You know ... there is one thing you could do to win me back."
Bolin says: "What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!"
Opal says: "Come on a secret mission with us."
Bolin says: "Where to?"
Opal says: "Zaofu. We're going to rescue my family."
