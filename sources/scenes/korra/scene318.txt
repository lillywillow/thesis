Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo says: "Korra!"
Ikki says: "We missed you so much, Korra."
Korra says: "I missed you so much, too. How did you find me all the way out here?"
Ikki says: "Jinora sensed your energy."
Jinora says: "But we never would have been here if it weren't for Ikki."
Ikki says: "I never would have stormed off and run into those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo."
Meelo says: "I was trying to toughen up these ladies, but I guess it was a team effort."
Ikki says: "I love your hair."
Meelo says: "It's so you."
Korra says: "I'm so sorry. This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki. Aang and Katara's grandchildren."
Toph says: "Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt."
Meelo says: "Wait a minute. Cranky? Old? Blind? You must be Toph!"
Toph says: "Oh, I like this one."
Jinora says: "You need to come home, Korra. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom."
Ikki says: "You have to stop her."
Korra says: "I don't know ... I'm not the Avatar I used to be. I can't even go into the Avatar State."
Ikki says: "Please, Korra."
Jinora says: "The world needs you back."
Korra says: "All right. I'm ready."
Toph says: "I'm not bending it out of you. You've got to do this on your own."
Toph says: "Close your eyes. Clear your mind. And don't freak out, like last time! Now, focus your energy. Find the metal. Let it move through you body."
Toph says: "That fight is over. Release the fear."
Toph says: "Well done, Korra."
Meelo says: "The Avatar is back in business!"
Korra says: "I feel so much lighter. Thank you so much for helping me. I'd like to give you a hug now, if that's okay with you."
Toph says: "All right, you earned it."
