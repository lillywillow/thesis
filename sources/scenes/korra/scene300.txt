Meelo says: "You're pretty, can I have some of your hair?"
Mako says: "Looks like I have some competition."
Ikki says: "And now for the grand tour.  The flying bison sleep in those caves down there.  And that's the temple Grandpa Aang built.  And that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat."
Bolin says: "I have a couple of questions.  Is this an all vegetarian island?  Is that where you train airbending?  Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? Do we each get our own sky bison? And final question, how many trees are on this island?"
Ikki says: "Yes. Yes. No. No. Ten thousand five hundred and fifty two."
Mako says: "So, where are we going to be staying?"
Meelo says: "You're a boy.  Boys have to stay on the boys' side."
Jinora says: "I'd be happy to show you to the men's dormitory."
Bolin says: "I'm a boy!"
Korra says: "Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?"
Meelo says: "We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman."
Korra says: "Ikki and I will take you to your room this way."
