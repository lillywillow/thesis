Suyin says: "And good morning to you, Lin. Now don't get mad, Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet."
Lin says: "What! You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go and stab me in the back?"
Suyin says: "Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move."
Lin says: "I can try."
