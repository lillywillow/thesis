Jinora says: "Professor Zei!"
Wan Shi Tong says: "I see that you have some knowledge of the past, so you should know that humans are no longer allowed in my library. Get out."
Jinora says: "I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge?"
Wan Shi Tong says: "Those are the old rules. Besides, what has a little girl got to teach Wan Shi Tong, he who knows ten thousand things?"
Jinora says: "Well, since you've been down in the Spirit World, the humans have invented radio."
Wan Shi Tong says: "Yes, I am well aware of the radio."
Jinora says: "But do you know how it works?"
Wan Shi Tong says: "Of course I do! There is a box, and inside the box, there is a tiny man who sings and plays musical instruments."
Jinora says: "Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves. Radio takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum-"
Wan Shi Tong says: "All right, enough. I did not know this.  Apparently, I have been fed some misinformation about the existence of tiny men in boxes.  Still, I am not interested in that human garbage. Now, go away."
Jinora says: "My grandfather was the Avatar, and I came to the Spirit World with the new Avatar to find the spirit portals. I would think that you'd wanna help me."
Wan Shi Tong says: "You came with the Avatar, hm? Well, why didn't you say so! Fine, you may look around. But don't break anything- I'll know."
Jinora says: "Come on, Furry-Foot, we gotta hurry!"
