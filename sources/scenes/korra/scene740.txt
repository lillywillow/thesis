Tenzin says: "Are you all right? Where are you?"
Korra says: "With Beifong's sister in Zaofu. We're totally safe, unless we get caught in another fight between Su and Lin."
Tenzin says: "Lin willingly took you to her sister?"
Korra says: "Not exactly. We got a call about an airbender and it turned out to be Su's daughter Opal. She'll be headed your way soon."
Tenzin says: "Really? That's wonderful!"
Bolin says: "She is wonderful, and pretty,  and so smart, and she smells like flowers ...  Sorry. Bolin, out."
Korra says: "How's the training going?"
Tenzin says: "Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation."
Korra says: "You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi? He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated."
Tenzin says: "Bumi?! He's my worst student."
Korra says: "Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea."
Tenzin says: "That actually sounds like a good plan. You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all."
Korra says: "Conflict resolution, that's what I do."
