Suyin says: "You really think Naga could track Aiwei?"
Korra says: "Definitely."

Korra says: "What? Why?"
Suyin says: "Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me."
Bolin says: "But you said -"
Suyin says: "I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time. Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning."
Korra says: "Let's get this guy!  Thanks."
