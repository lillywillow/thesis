Tenzin says: "What happened?  What was Korra doing at City Hall?"
Tarrlok says: "As I told Chief Saikhan,  Korra came to my office late last night. She was upset that I arrested her friends. She asked me to release them and ... that's when the Equalists attacked.  I tried to protect Korra, but we were outnumbered.  Then, I was electrocuted.  When I came to, the police had arrived. But Korra was gone.  I'm so sorry.  Chief Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force. We have to find the Avatar."
