Tenzin says: "I know that none of you chose to become airbenders. But now you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide is up to you."
Yung says: "I want to go with you."
Other airbender #1 says: "Me too."
Other airbender #2 says: "Count me in."
Korra says: "Good luck at the Northern Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them."
Tenzin says: "Be careful out there. Stay safe."
Korra says: "I'll try. Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy."
Tenzin says: "But you made some new friends too. You did well, Korra."
Korra says: "This is only the beginning."
