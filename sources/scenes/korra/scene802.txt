Mako says: "Can't sleep either?"
Korra says: "No, I have this awful pit in my stomach."
Mako says: "Me too."
Korra says: "It's so crazy. A few months ago I was in the South Pole practicing for my firebending test,  and now I'm in the middle of an all-out war."
Mako says: "I know, we didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it.  You're the most loyal, brave, and selfless person I've ever known."
Korra says: "I think you're pretty incredible too, but ... you already knew that."
Korra says: "I should probably try to get some sleep."
Mako says: "Me too. Good night."
Korra says: "Good night."
Amon says: "You will now be cleansed of your impurity.  Next."
Mako says: "Coast is clear."
Korra says: "Once the United Forces arrive, we need to be ready to help in any way we can."
Mako says: "They're here!"
Bolin says: "Whoops!"
Iroh says: "Hmm ... Amon had to know we were coming. So why aren't we meeting any resistance?"
