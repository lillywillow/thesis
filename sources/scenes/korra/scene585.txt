Wu says: "Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me.  Where did you get those shirts?"
Girl #1 says: "Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero."
Girl #2 says: "They're selling them over there."
Wu says: "You can't sell that junk in here! This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here! Respect the brooch!"
Crowd says: "Stop it, Little King!"
Wu says: "I am the Glorious Defender!"
Crowd says: "I'm covered in juice! Get him!"
Mako says: "We need to get you out of here."
Wu says: "It's destiny. Look where we are, Mako! The Royal Palace."
Little Boy says: "Hey! It's my birthday!"
Wu says: "It's my coronation day! You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again! Never!"
Mako says: "Okay, you're losing it."
Wu says: "This is the worst day of my life!"
Mako says: "Why? Do you really want to be the king? I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as your king? What have you ever done for your people?  I'm sorry, that was out of line."
Wu says: "No, you're right. No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved."
Mako says: "Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe."
Wu says: "Carry me?"
Mako says: "No."
