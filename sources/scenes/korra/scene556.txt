Butakha says: "There are my little hard-working street urchins.  It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar."
Korra says: "And you are ...?"
Butakha says: "Butakha. I run this whole pro-bending shebang.  Here's your winnings from the last match.  Ah ah ah, not so fast.  First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear,  gym and equipment rentals from last month,  rent on your apartment,  and a personal loan for groceries."
Bolin says: "What?  I'm a growing boy!"
Butakha says: "Oh, and one more small item of business: The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the championship pot."
Bolin says: "Thirty thousand yuans?!"
Butakha says: "Sorry, kids. You got 'til the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament."
Bolin says: "You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account overflowing with gold, would you?"
Korra says: "I got nothing.  I've never really needed money.  I've always had people taking care of me."
Mako says: "Then I wouldn't say you have nothing."
Korra says: "Sorry, I didn't mean â€”"
Bolin says: "No, it's all right. It's just  ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own."
Korra says: "I'm so sorry. I didn't know."
Mako says: "So, anyway,  how are we gonna come up with the money?"
Bolin says: "Oh, oh, I got it!  I got it!  I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks. Now people would pay good money to see that!"
Mako says: "Come on, Bolin.  We need serious ideas."
Bolin says: "I was serious."
Mako says: "Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. I always do."
