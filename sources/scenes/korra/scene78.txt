Tenzin says: "Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt."
Lin says: "I know what I am doing and the risks that come with it."
Tenzin says: "In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match."
Lin says: "You don't need to babysit me."
Tenzin says: "It's for Korra. I want to make sure she's safe."
Lin says: "Do what you want! It's not like I've ever been able to stop you before."
Korra says: "Excuse me, Chief Beifong. I wanted to thank you for your help,  it ... really ... means a lot ...  What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me!"
Tenzin says: "I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ...  challenging."
Korra says: "What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?"
Tenzin says: "My father and Lin got along famously.  I'm afraid her issues ... are with me."
Korra says: "Wait a second ...  it all makes sense now!  You and Beifong, Beifong and you. You two were a  couple!"
Tenzin says: "What! How-?  Where'd you get that idea?"
Korra says: "Ha!  Your wife."
Tenzin says: "Criminy! I'll have to have a word with her."
Korra says: "So ... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our "esteemed Chief of Police" didn't throw her in jail."
Tenzin says: "Oh, she tried.  Anyway, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in li-  Why am I even telling you this? It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it."
Korra says: "Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't."
Tenzin says: "What do you ...  Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business!"
Korra says: "See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!"
