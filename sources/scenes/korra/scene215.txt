Mako says: "How was your day, sweetie?"
Korra says: "Oh, fabulous.  My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?"
Mako says: "Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that."
Korra says: "Ugh. I'm sorry. My dad just gets me all worked up."
Mako says: "How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner. Just the two of us."
