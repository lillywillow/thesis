Bolin says: "Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains--  --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear."
Varrick says: "We're not going to Zaofu, that place is doomed! We gotta head to Republic City!"
Bolin says: "What? No, nonono, we gotta help here."
Varrick says: "We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential superweapon!"
Bolin says: "Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping.  Hmm. Let me think about this."
Varrick says: "That's not the flamethrower! What idiot designed these things?"
Zhu Li says: "You did, sir!"
Varrick says: "Less lecturing, more saving my life!"
Varrick says: "Hey! I think I figured it out!"
Zhu Li says: "Sir, you're making this very difficult."
