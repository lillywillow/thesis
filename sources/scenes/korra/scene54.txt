Mako says: "Ahhhh!"
Asami Sato says: "Oh no! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!"
Mako says: "How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juuuu  I was, I-I, wow.  That was ..."
Wu says: "Wait. That was the first thing you said to Asami? You really gotta work on your introductions."
Mako says: "Hey. When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions."
Mako says: "Hanging out with Asami was awesome. But it made things with Korra  complicated."
Korra says: "So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.  Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other."
Mako says: "Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you."
Wu says: "That's harsh, Mako."
Mako says: "I know.  And the worst part about it is, it wasn't totally true."
