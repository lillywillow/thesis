Asami says: "My company ... it's over ... I give up."
Mako says: "Well ... I'm not giving up on you."
Mako says: "I know, I know, don't tell me ... I had no right kissing Asami."
Wu says: "No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, you're free to smooch whoever you wish."
Mako says: "If only it had been that simple."
