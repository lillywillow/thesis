Korra says: "Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?"
Bolin says: "Can we not talk about dark spirits, please?"
Mako says: "My brother doesn't like ghost stories."
Eska says: "Don't worry. I will protect you, my feeble turtle duck."
Bolin says: "Thank you."
Unalaq says: "Sadly, this isn't a ghost story. This is real.  The spirits are angry because he's here.  Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the South Pole? Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?"
Tonraq says: "Unalaq, this is not the time."
Unalaq says: "You're right. You should have told her a long time ago."
Korra says: "Told me what!?"
Tonraq says: "I left the North Pole because ... I was banished."
Korra says: "You were banished from the North? Why?"
Tonraq says: "Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe.  Twenty years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people."
Young Unalaq says: "Brother! We're being attacked!"
