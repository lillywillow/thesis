Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Korra Kya Mako Raiko Tenzin Tonraq Varrick Antagonists Dark spirits Desna and Eska Unalaq says: "Minor Buttercup Raiko Ginger Ikki Jinora Katara Lin Beifong Lu and Gang Meelo Naga Oogi Pabu Pema Shiro Shinobi Song Zhu Li"
Shiro Shinobi says: "The Equalists are on the attack! The Lieutenant and his chi blockers invaded Air Temple Island and forced Tenzin and his family to flee! In the daring escape, Lin Beifong sacrificed herself and saved the airbenders, but she was captured and Amon took her bending away. Now, Team Avatar is in hiding as they await help from General Iroh and the United Forces."
Hiroshi Sato says: "It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters! Amon has torn down the tyrannical bending government!  He has declared bending illegal,  and he has the Avatar on the run.  Our great leader has a vision for the future. One day soon, bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world where everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream. But we will prevail!"
Korra says: "Can you believe Hiroshi?! "The Avatar's on the run". I'm not running from anyone! Let's go back up there and knock some heads; they'll never know what hit 'em."
Mako says: "Relax. General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships. Then Amon will be the one who's running."
Korra says: "I hate this "being patient" stuff."
