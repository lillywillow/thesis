Asami says: "She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job."
Korra says: "No time for a test run. Let's move!"
Arik says: "I think he's gone. We did it!"
Asami says: "You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?"
Captain says: "Thanks, Asami. You got a good head on your shoulders."
Korra says: "I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there. I didn't mean for that to happen."
Captain says: "You know, whatever the conflict between you and the queen is, I'm sure it's above my pay grade.  You've got a tough job. Good luck, Avatar."
Arik says: "Captain, have we been in the desert for too long? Or is that really a dragon over there?"
Captain says: "Ugh, let's go get a drink."
Korra says: "Dhaaah!  Easy, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back to you?"
Korra says: "What are you all doing here?"
Tonraq says: "Korra, you're safe."
Korra says: "Yeah, we made it out of the desert. Thanks to Asami."
Tonraq says: "Do you remember Lord Zuko?"
Zuko says: "I met you when you were a very young girl. It's good to see you again, Avatar Korra."
Korra says: "It's good to see you, Lord Zuko."
Lin says: "Thanks for ditching me back at Zaofu."
Korra says: "Yeah, sorry about that. But, how did you all find us?"
Lin says: "I am a detective, you know."
Asami says: "Did you find Mako and Bolin?"
Lin says: "Some people at the inn saw them captured by Zaheer's crew. We don't know where they are."
Tonraq says: "Did you hear about the Earth Queen?"
Korra says: "What about her?"
Radio says: "Once again, the Earth Queen's reign has come to an abrupt and violent end. Ba Sing Se has descended into chaos. Rioters and looters have overrun the palace."
Korra says: "The Red Lotus."
Tonraq says: "What's that?"
Korra says: "The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen. I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad."
