Opal says: "We should be thinking of a way to take out Kuvira while we have the chance."
Bolin says: "Or at least destroy the cannon. If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything."
Toph says: "I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family.  It will take everything we have just to get out alive."
Bolin says: "Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted."
Opal says: "Good thinking, Bolin."
Bolin says: "Thanks.  I kind of have a headache now."
