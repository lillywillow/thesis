Tenzin says: "Korra? Are you all right? Why are you back so soon?"
Korra says: "It's Kuvira. Our intel was wrong. She must have known Zhu Li had the information."
Raiko says: "What are you trying to say?"
Korra says: "Kuvira's army is only a few hours away."
Tenzin says: "No, they can't be! We're not ready."
Korra says: "And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit. It's over twenty-five stories tall!"
Raiko says: "Get General Iroh on the line and tell him that the attack is happening today. We need to lock down the city."
Tenzin says: "Pema! Find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety, immediately.  We can't have innocent lives in jeopardy."
Bolin says: "What should we do?"
Asami says: "Let's go to my factory. Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running."
Suyin says: "We're coming with you."
Korra says: "I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh."
