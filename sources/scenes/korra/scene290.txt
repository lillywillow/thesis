Korra says: "It's so good to see you!"
Tenzin says: "How have you been, Korra? You look great!"
Korra says: "I feel great!  Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing."
Korra says: "Attack! I can take it!"
Tenzin says: "All right! The sparring match is over!"
Korra says: "I thought I was ready."
Tenzin says: "There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery.  Being the Avatar can wait."
Korra says: "But what about the Earth Kingdom? I hear it's still a mess out there."
Tenzin says: "The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge."
Korra says: "But that should be me out there fixing things, not her."
Tenzin says: "I know you want to help. But trust me, everyone has this under control. I just think you need to ..."
Korra says: "If you say, "be patient", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!"
Tenzin says: "Nooo ... I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future. Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made."
