Tenzin says: "His pupils pleaded with their master  to eat something, but he refused,  just like he had each day during summer.  Instead he meditated and got his nourishment from the universe. So when Tang Xu completed the ninety-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?"
Otaku says: "Oooh! Oooh!"
Tenzin says: "Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?"
Otaku says: "Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Tenzin says: "And is answering every question."
Otaku says: "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Whaletail Island."
Tenzin says: "That is correct. Again. Now, on day ninety-eight ..."
Bumi says: "Greetings, air people. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World."
Kai says: "That is incredible! When do we get to fly around on our own sky bison like that?"
Tenzin says: "Only after many years of practice and intense training.  Besides, we don't have enough bison here for all of you."
Kai says: "What about those?  It's a whole herd of bisons."
Tenzin says: "Actually, the plural of bison is bison."
Recruits says: "Whoa! Cool! Wow look at that!"
Kai says: "Can we ride those?"
Tenzin says: "No, that's a wild herd. It would take many years to tame them. Now, let's get back to our lessons."
