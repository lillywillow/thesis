Yon Rha says: "Nobody sneaks up on me without getting burned!"
Zuko says: "We weren't behind the bush.  And I wouldn't try firebending again!"
Yon Rha says: "Whoever you are, take my money. Take whatever you want. I'll cooperate."
Katara says: "Do you know who I am?"
Yon Rha says: "No. I'm not sure."
Katara says: "Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look?"
Yon Rha says: "Yes, yes, I remember you now.  You're that little Water Tribe girl."
Kya says: "Just let her go and  I'll give you the information you want."
Yon Rha says: "You heard your mother. Get out of here!"
Young Katara says: "Mommy, I'm scared."
Kya says: "Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this."
Yon Rha says: "Now tell me, who is it? Who's the waterbender?"
Kya says: "There are no waterbenders here. The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago."
Yon Rha says: "You're lying. My source says there's one waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe. We're not leaving until we find the waterbender!"
Kya says: "If I tell you, do you promise  to leave the rest of the village alone?  It's me.  Take me as your prisoner."
Yon Rha says: "I'm afraid I'm not taking prisoners today ..."
Katara says: "She lied to you!  She was protecting the last waterbender!"
Yon Rha says: "What? Who?"
Katara says: "Me!"
Yon Rha says: "I did a bad thing! I know I did and you deserve revenge, so why don't you take my mother? That would be fair!"
Katara says: "I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty."
Yon Rha says: "Please, spare me!"
Katara says: "But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it."
