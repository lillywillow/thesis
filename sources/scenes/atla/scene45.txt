Gyatso says: "Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy."
Tashi says: "You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny."
Pasang says: "Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment."
Gyatso says: "All I want is what is best for him."
Pasang says: "But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training."
Katara says: "That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say."
Aang says: "How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!"
Katara says: "Whoa! Hot cinders!"
Aang says: "I'm sorry I got so mad."
Katara says: "You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that."
Aang says: "Well, that's not exactly what happened.  I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do."
Gyatso says: "Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?"
Aang says: "I never saw Gyatso again.  Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg."
Katara says: "You ran away."
Aang says: "And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help."
Katara says: "You don't know what would have-."
Aang says: "The world needed me and I wasn't there to help."
Katara says: "Aang ..."
Aang says: "The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world!"
Katara says: "You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders."
Aang says: "You don't know that."
Katara says: "I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope."
