Aang says: "Oh, I didn't see you there."
Meng says: "You don't like me, do you?"
Aang says: "Of course I like you."
Meng says: "But not the way I like you."
Aang says: "Oh, I guess not."
Meng says: "It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way."
Aang says: "I know what you mean."
Meng says: "She's beautiful, by the way."
Aang says: "Huh?"
Meng says: "That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.  She's sweet, she's a bender  and her hair seems so manageable."
Aang says: "Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it."
Meng says: "Thanks.  Wait! Don't you want this?"
Aang says: "How did you know?"
Meng says: "I've kind of been stalking you.  Heh ..."
Aang says: "Oh, thanks ... I guess."
