Toph says: "That's where I met them."
Toph says: "They were blind, just like me.  So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending,  not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses.  For them, the original earthbenders,  it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world."
Aang says: "That's amazing, Toph!"
Aang says: "I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison.  Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy."
Zuko says: "Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct."
Aang says: "What do you meanâ€Œ? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid."
Zuko says: "Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?"
Aang says: "Okay, okay.  I'm sorry."
Zuko says: "But maybe there's another way.  The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors."
Aang says: "Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid."
Zuko says: "No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.  Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins."
Aang says: "It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present."
Sokka says: "So, what?  Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood a thousand years ago?"
Zuko says: "More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend,  or the Avatar has to find a new teacher."
