Toph says: "And then when I was nine, I ran away again."
Zuko says: "Uh-huh."
Toph says: "I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean?"
Zuko says: "Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang."
Toph says: "This is the worst field trip ever."
Sokka says: "Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either."
Zuko says: "No. It's like he just ... disappeared."
Toph says: "Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too?"
Sokka says: "Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time!  Appa ate Momo!  Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy."
Katara says: "Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang."
Sokka says: "That's just what Appa wants you to think."
Zuko says: "Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away."
Katara says: "What should we do Zuko?"
Zuko says: "I don't know.  Why are you all looking at me?"
Katara says: "Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang."
Toph says: "Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you."
