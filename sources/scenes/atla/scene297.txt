Aang says: "I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.  Bumi, you're a mad genius."
Bumi says: "Oh Aang, it's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally."
Katara says: "Uh, over here!"
Sokka says: "Little help?"
Bumi says: "Jennamite is made of rock candy.  Delicious!"
Katara says: "So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?"
Bumi says: "Who are you calling old? Okay, I'm old."
Sokka says: "Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were?"
Bumi says: "First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people.  But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation.  And you'll need Momo, too."
Aang says: "Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you."
