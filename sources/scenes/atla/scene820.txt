Zuko says: "Uncle,  I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.  But I want you to know,  I am so, so, sorry, Uncle. I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did. I don't know how I can ever make it up to you. But I'll-  How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me."
Iroh says: "I was never angry with you. I was sad because I was afraid you lost your way."
Zuko says: "I did lose my way."
Iroh says: "But you found it again.  And you did it by yourself.  And I am so happy you found your way here."
Zuko says: "It wasn't that hard, Uncle. You have a pretty strong scent."
Aang says: "Wait.  Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger?"
