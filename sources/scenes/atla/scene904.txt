Sun Warrior chief says: "If you're going to see the masters,  you must bring them a piece of the Eternal Flame.  This fire is the very first one.  It was given to man by the dragons.  We have kept it going for thousands of years."
Zuko says: "I don't believe it."
Sun Warrior chief says: "You will each take a piece of it to the masters, to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending."
Aang says: "Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sirâ€Œ, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet.  Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?"
Sun Warrior chief says: "No.  This ritual illustrates  the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy.  You must maintain a constant heat. The flame will go out if you make it too small.  Make it too big, and you might lose control."
Aang says: "I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.  It's like a little heartbeat."
Sun Warrior chief says: "Fire is life,  not just destruction. You will take your flames up there.  The cave of the masters is beneath that rock."
Zuko says: "Hurry up."
Aang says: "I can't.  If I walk too fast, my flame will go out."
Zuko says: "Your flame's  gonna go out  because it's too small. You're too timid, give it more juice."
Aang says: "But what if I can't control it?"
Zuko says: "You can do it. I know you can.  You're a talented kid."
