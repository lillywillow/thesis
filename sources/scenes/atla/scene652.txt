Iroh says: "Spare coins for weary travelers?"
Zuko says: "This is humiliating! We're royalty! These people should be giving us whatever we want."
Iroh says: "They will if you ask nicely.  Spare change for a hungry old man?"
Peasant girl says: "Aw, here you go."
Iroh says: "The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile!"
Broadsword man says: "How about some entertainment in exchange for ... a gold piece?"
Zuko says: "We're not performers."
Iroh says: "Not professional anyway.  It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty!"
Broadsword man says: "Come on, we're talking a gold piece here! Let's see some action!  Dance!"
Iroh says: "They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se!"
Broadsword man says: "Ha, ha! Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner! Here ya go!"
Iroh says: "Such a kind man."
Sokka says: "Hey, you taking us down for a reason?  Aang,  why are we going down?"
Aang says: "What? I didn't even notice."
Sokka says: "Are you noticing now?"
Katara says: "Is something wrong?"
Aang says: "I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me."
Sokka says: "Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?"
Aang says: "No, I ... I think it wants us to land there."
Sokka says: "No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on."
Aang says: "I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?"
Sokka says: "Yes."
Katara says: "I don't know. There's something ominous about that place."
Sokka says: "See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here."
Aang says: "Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this,  bye swamp.  Yip, Yip!"
Sokka says: "You better throw in an extra "yip"! We gotta move!"
Aang says: "Where's Appa and Momo?  Appa! Momo!"
