Aang says: "I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible."
Katara says: "I know. That's why I took this."
Aang says: "No way!"
Katara says: "Isn't it great?"
Sokka says: "No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll!"
Katara says: "I prefer to think of it as high risk trading."
Aang says: "Good one, Katara."
Katara says: "Sokka, where do you think theyÂ got it? They stole it from a waterbender!"
Sokka says: "It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes."
Katara says: "These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending!"
Sokka says: "Whatever."
Aang says: "Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it."
