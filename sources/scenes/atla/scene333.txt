Sokka says: "I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls."
Sokka says: "Sorry ladies,  didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.  I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?"
Suki says: "Well, you're in the right place.  Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar."
Sokka says: "It's all right.  I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception."
Suki says: "I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance."
Sokka says: "True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village."
Suki says: "Wow! Best warrior, huh?  In your whole village?  Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration."
Sokka says: "Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ..."
Suki says: "Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?"
Sokka says: "Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to.  All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me."
Sokka says: "Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you."
Suki says: "Of course."
