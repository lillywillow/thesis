Aang says: "Momo!"
Toph says: "There's no one else here."
Aang says: "Katara is in trouble! I knew it!"
Sokka says: "Oh, no!"
Toph says: "Wait! Someone's at the door.  Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.  Glad to see you're okay."
Iroh says: "I need your help."
Aang says: "You guys know each other?"
Toph says: "I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Â Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice."
Iroh says: "May I come in?  Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se."
Aang says: "She must have Katara."
Iroh says: "She has captured my nephew as well."
Aang says: "Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko."
Sokka says: "Whoa there! You lost me at "Zuko"."
Iroh says: "I know how you must feel about my nephew.  But believe me when I tell you that there is good inside him."
Sokka says: ""Good inside him" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?"
Aang says: "Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance."
Iroh says: "I brought someone along who might help us."
Captured agent says: "Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup! They're going to overthrow the Earth King!"
Sokka says: "My sister! Where are they keeping Katara?"
Captured agent says: "In the Crystal Catacombs of Old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace."
