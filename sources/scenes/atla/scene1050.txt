Zuko says: "Maybe we should make camp."
Iroh says: "No please, don't stop just for me!"
Iroh says: "What now?"
Iroh says: "Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!"
Mongke says: "If you're surprised we're here, then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps."
Zuko says: "You know these guys?"
Iroh says: "Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist.  They are also a very capable singing group."
