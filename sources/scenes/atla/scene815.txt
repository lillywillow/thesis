Aang says: "Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life,  but I just don't know if I can do that."
Avatar Roku says: "In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint, but it backfired when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy.  If I had been more decisive and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin and stopped the war before it started.  I offer you this wisdom, Aang: You must be decisive."
