Aang says: "Hey there, fellow. You look hungry."
Kenji says: "They are hungry.  The Dai Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke."
Aang says: "What kinda animal is that?"
Kenji says: "Oh, that's a rabaroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes.  I'd let her hop away to happiness."
Aang says: "Let's do it!"
Kenji says: "Say again?"
Aang says: "There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city."
Kenji says: "But how're you gonna transport all these wild critters?"
Aang says: "Don't worry, I'm great with animals."
