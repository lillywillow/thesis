Katara says: "Who are all these people?"
Aang says: "I'm not sure.  But it feels like I know them somehow. Look!  That one's an airbender."
Katara says: "And this one's a waterbender.  They're lined up in a pattern:  air, water, earth and fire."
Aang says: "That's the Avatar Cycle."
Katara says: "Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang."
Aang says: "Wow! There are so many!"
Sokka says: "Past lives?  Katara, you really believe in that stuff?"
Katara says: "It's true.  When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle."
