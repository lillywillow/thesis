Aang says: "Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price!  No, I'm not gonna end it like this."
Ozai says: "Even with all the power in the world, you are still weak!"
Lion turtle says: "In the era before the Avatar, we bent not the elements but the energy within ourselves."
Lion turtle says: "To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable or you will be corrupted and destroyed."
Ozai says: "What? What did you do to me?"
Aang says: "I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again."
Sokka says: "You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like  and the Fire Lord was all like"
Suki says: "So did you, you know ... finish the job?"
Ozai says: "I'm still alive."
Aang says: "I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away."
Toph says: "Wow! Who taught you that?"
Aang says: "A giant lion turtle."
Toph says: "You have the craziest adventures when you disappear."
Sokka says: "Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord."
Ozai says: "I am the Phoenix King!"
Toph says: "Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Phoenix King of Getting His Butt Whooped."
Suki says: "Yeah! Or how about King of the ... Guys Who ... Don't Win?"
Toph says: "Leave the nicknames to us, honey."
