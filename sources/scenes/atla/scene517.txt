Arnook says: "Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe. And they have brought with them, someone very special, someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now ... the Avatar!  We also celebrate my daughter's sixteenth birthday. Princess Yue is now of marrying age!"
Yue says: "Thank you, Father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times!"
Arnook says: "Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!"
Sokka says: "Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe."
Yue says: "Very nice to meet you."
Sokka says: "So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh?  You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself."
Katara says: "Ha, prince of what?"
Sokka says: "A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here."
Katara says: "My apologies, Prince Sokka."
Sokka says: "So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together?"
Yue says: "Do an activity?"
Katara says: "Very smooth ..."
