Zhao says: "You? Stop me? Impossible."
Zuko says: "Don't underestimate me, Zhao! I will capture the Avatar before you!"
Iroh says: "Prince Zuko, that's enough."
Zhao says: "You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of war ships under my command and you? You're just a banished prince. No home, no allies. Your own father doesn't even want you."
Zuko says: "You're wrong! Once I deliver the Avatar to my father, he will welcome me home with honor, and restore my rightful place on the throne!"
Zhao says: "If your father really wanted you home, he would have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar. But in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation."
Zuko says: "That's not true."
Zhao says: "You have the scar to prove it."
Zuko says: "Maybe you'd like one to match!"
Zhao says: "Is that a challenge?"
Zuko says: "An Agni Kai. At sunset."
Zhao says: "Very well.  It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you.  I guess your uncle will do."
Iroh says: "Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?"
Zuko says: "I will never forget."
