Katara says: "So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work."
Toph says: "Hey, don't worry about me. I'm good to go."
Katara says: "Well, actually what I'm trying to say is,  some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent.  Even Momo does his fair share."
Toph says: "Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire,  I've already collected my own food and look,  my tent's all set up."
Katara says: "Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish -"
Toph says: "I don't understand what's the problem here!"
Katara says: "Never mind."
Aang says: "Sorry!"
