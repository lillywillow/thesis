Sokka says: "That settles it! No more school for you, young man!"
Aang says: "I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time."
Toph says: "Ha ha!"
Aang says: "Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom."
Sokka says: "What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?"
Aang says: "I'm gonna throw them,  a secret dance party!"
Sokka says: "Go to your room!"
