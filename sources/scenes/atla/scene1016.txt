Aang says: "Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo."
Katara says: "Do you think we'll really find airbenders?"
Sokka says: "You want me to be like you, or totally honest?"
Katara says: "Are you saying I'm a liar?"
Sokka says: "I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically."
Aang says: "Hey, guys, look at this!"
Katara says: "They really are airbenders!"
Aang says: "No, they're not."
Sokka says: "What do you mean "they're not"? Those guys are flying!"
Aang says: "Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit."
Katara says: "I don't know, Aang. That kid seemed pretty spirited."
Sokka says: "We better find some solid ground, before it finds us."
Colonists says: "Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!"
Teo says: "Hey there, you're pretty good!"
Aang says: "Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding."
