Azula says: "You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.  I must find the Avatar to restore my honor!  It's okay, you can laugh. It's funny."
Aang says: "So what now?"
Azula says: "Now? Now, it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go.  You can run, but I'll catch you."
Aang says: "I'm not running."
