Toph says: "How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!"
Katara says: "You brought this on yourself. I had no choice."
Aang says: "Okay. I'm ready for some training."
Toph says: "Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack."
Katara says: "Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph!"
Toph says: "What's the matter? Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches?"
Katara says: "Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?"
Aang says: "Are we taking a break?"
Sokka says: "Sneak Attack!"
Aang says: "Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud."
Toph says: "Hungry for a mud pie?"
Katara says: "I'll give you a mud pie!"
Aang says: "Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me."
Katara says: "Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today."
Toph says: "While Katara cleans up,  let's go have some fun!"
Aang says: "Yeah!"
Sokka says: "Yes!"
Sokka says: "Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages."
Toph says: "I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you."
Aang says: "So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece?"
Toph says: "We can get more money.  Right there."
Toph says: "This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending."
Dealer says: "You there. Wanna play a friendly game?"
Toph says: "How can I possibly play?  I'm blind."
Dealer says: "You don't have to see to be lucky."
Aang says: "Flamey-O, Toph."
Dealer says: "Wow. Fancy guessing. You are amazing at this.  Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?"
Toph says: "More interesting? How?"
Dealer says: "Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there,  then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting."
Toph says: "I'll do it for forty silver pieces."
Dealer says: "Forty silver pieces it is."
Dealer says: "Sorry, little lady, but-  Huh?"
Toph says: "I won!"
