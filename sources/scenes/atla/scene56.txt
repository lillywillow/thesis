Fisherman's wife says: "Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology!"
Aang says: "He doesn't have to apologize."
Fisherman says: "What if, instead of an apology, I give him a free fish and we call it even?"
Aang says: "Actually, I don't eat meat."
Fisherman says: "Fish ain't meat!"
Sokka says: "Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right?"
Aang says: "Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past."
Katara says: "Really?"
Aang says: "I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it."
Katara says: "I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore."
Fisherman says: "And if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either. Thank you for saving my life, Avatar."
Sokka says: "Do you hear that? It stopped raining."
Aang says: "Appa!"
