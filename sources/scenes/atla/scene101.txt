Hakoda says: "Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops.  Ahh!"
Katara says: "You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore."

Sokka says: "Can't you heal him any faster?"
Katara says: "I'm doing everything I can."
Sokka says: "I'll do it."
Katara says: "No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands."
Sokka says: "No.  I'll lead the invasion force."
Katara says: "Don't be crazy Sokka."
Sokka says: "Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does."
Hakoda says: "You can do this.  I'm proud of you son."
Katara says: "I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too."
Sokka says: "Yip yip."
