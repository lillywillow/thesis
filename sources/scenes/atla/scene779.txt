Azula says: "Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house."
Chan says: "Is this your first time on Ember Island?"
Azula says: "No. I used to come here years ago."
Chan says: "It's a great place, if you like sand.  Yeah, it's like, welcome to Sandy Land!"
Azula says: "Your arms look so strong."
Chan says: "Yeah, I know.  You're pretty."
Azula says: "Together,  you and I will be the strongest couple in the entire world!  We will dominate the Earth!"
Chan says: "Uh ... I got to go."
Zuko says: "Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend!"
Ruon-Jian says: "What are you doing?"
Zuko says: "Stop talking to my girlfriend!"
Ruon-Jian says: "Relax. It's just a party."
Mai says: "Zuko, what is wrong with you?"
Zuko says: "What's wrong with me?"
Mai says: "Your temper is out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hotheaded and angry!"
Zuko says: "Well, at least I feel something, as opposed to you.  You have no passion for anything! You're just a big blah!"
Mai says: "It's over, Zuko. We're done."
Chan says: "Who broke my nana's vase?  That's it! You're out of here!"
Zuko says: "I was just leaving."
Ruon-Jian says: "Have fun by yourself, loser boy."
Chan says: "Nice."
