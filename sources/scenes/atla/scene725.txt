Toph says: "Well, what'd you know? There is an ancient city down there. But it's deep."
Sokka says: "We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk,  no offense."
Iroh says: "None taken."
Sokka says: "And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup."
Aang says: "So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea!"
Iroh says: "The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?"
Aang says: "Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this great power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love.  And I just couldn't."
Iroh says: "Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love."
Aang says: "What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State,Â what if I'm not powerful enough?"
Iroh says: "I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving,  you will come to a better place."
