Sokka says: "You guys are not gonna believe this! There's a play about us."
Suki says: "We were just in town and we found this poster!"
Katara says: "What? How is that possible?"
Sokka says: "Listen to this ...  "The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim,  who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.  His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.""
Suki says: ""Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players.""
Zuko says: "Ugh! My mother used to take us to see them. They butchered Love Amongst the Dragons every year!"
Katara says: "Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?"
Sokka says: "Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing!"
Aang says: "Hey, uh ... I wanted to sit there."
Zuko says: "Just sit next to me. What's the big deal?"
Aang says: "I was just, I wanted to ... okay."
Toph says: "Why are we sitting in the nosebleed section? My feet can't see a thing from up here!"
Katara says: "Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening."
Actress Katara says: "Sokka, my only brother! We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas, and yet never do we find anything fulfilling!"
Actor Sokka says: "All I want is a full feeling in my stomach! I'm starving!"
Actress Katara says: "Is food the only thing on your mind?"
Actor Sokka says: "Well, I'm trying to it get out of my mind and into my mouth! I'm starving!"
Sokka says: "This is pathetic! My jokes are way funnier than this!"
Toph says: "I think he's got you pegged!"
Actress Katara says: "Every day, the world awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears!  Still, we cannot give up hope! For hope,  is all we have! And we must never relinquish it, even ...  even to our dying breath!"
