Chong says: "Hey-hey! We're here!"
Sokka says: "What exactly is this curse?"
Chong says: "The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever."
Lily says: "And die."
Chong says: "Oh yeah, and die.  Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song!  And die!"
Sokka says: "That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!"
Moku says: "Hey, someone's making a big campfire!"
Katara says: "That's no campfire, Moku."
Sokka says: "It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us."
Aang says: "So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?"
Chong says: "That is correct, Master Arrowhead."
Aang says: "We can make it."
Sokka says: "Everyone into the hole!"
Commander says: "Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest."
