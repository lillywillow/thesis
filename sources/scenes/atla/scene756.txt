Sokka says: "Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you."
Aang says: "You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days."
Sokka says: "Tell me more about this "Fire Lord". Why are you so afraid of him?"
Aang says: "You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world!"
Sokka says: "Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil."
Aang says: "Okay! But what can I do to feel better?"
Sokka says: "Want to try screaming into this pillow?"
