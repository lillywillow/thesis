Sokka says: "Gather round, Team Avatar.  In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect.  First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense,  and while the Melon Lord is distracted,  Aang swoops in ... and bam!  He delivers the final blow."
Toph says: "Uh ... what about me?"
Sokka says: "For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces."
Toph says: "So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?"
Sokka says: "Whatever makes the training feel more realistic."
Toph says: "Sweetness."
Toph says: "Mwah-ha-ha-ha!"
Sokka says: "Watch it, Toph!"
Toph says: "I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Sokka says: "Now, Aang!"
Zuko says: "What are you waiting for? Take him out!"
Aang says: "I can't."
Sokka says: "What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now."
Aang says: "I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself."
Sokka says: "There, that's how it's done."
