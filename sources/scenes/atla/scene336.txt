Katara says: "Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room?  It's a little heavy."
Aang says: "Actually, I can't right now."
Katara says: "What do you mean, "you can't?""
Aang says: "I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!"
Katara says: "Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun."
Aang says: "Well, neither does carrying your basket."
Katara says: "It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon."
Aang says: "I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it,  but there's something I really like about this place."
Koko says: "What's taking you so long, Aangy?"
