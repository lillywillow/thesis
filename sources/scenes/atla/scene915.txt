Sokka says: "So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?"
Zhang leader says: "What for? Its the dry season."
Sokka says: "Exactly!"
Zhang leader says: "Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket."
Sokka says: "Finally, someone gets it!"
Katara says: "You really think it'll rain?"
Gan Jin leader says: "No, but you can never be too careful, right?"
Gan Jin leader says: "Would you care for some bread, Katara?"
Katara says: "So it was you guys who had food!"
Gan Jin leader says: "Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?"
Katara says: "Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.  So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much?"
Gan Jin leader says: "You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.  The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb.  Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang."
