Aang says: "Thanks for everything, guys."
Katara says: "So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep?"
Aang says: "Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better.  Maybe."
Sokka says: "Then our work here is done."
Katara says: "What happened, Aang?"
Aang says: "It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse."
Sokka says: "Looks like it's time for another ...  therapy session."
Aang says: "No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion!"
