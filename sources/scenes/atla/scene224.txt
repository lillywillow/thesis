Yung says: "Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered."
Yung says: "The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do.  He looked me in the eye and said ..."
King Bumi says: "I'm going to do ... nothing!"
Yung says: "It doesn't matter now.  Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom.  And freedom is worth dying for."
Aang says: "Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.  But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day."
Yung says: "You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost!"
Resistance fighter #1 says: "I don't know, Yung, living to fight another day is startin' to sound pretty good to me."
Resistance fighter #2 says: "Yeah, I'm with the kid!"
Yung says: "Fine. But there's thousands of citizens that need to leave. How're we going to get them all out?"
Sokka says: "Suckers!"
Sokka says: "You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox."
