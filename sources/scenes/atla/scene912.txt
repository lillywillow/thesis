Aang says: "With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable."
Sokka says: "Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there."
Zuko says: "It's not a dance. It's a firebending form."
Sokka says: "We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord."
Zuko says: "It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!"
Katara says: "Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌?"
Zuko says: "The Dancing Dragon."
Main Aang Zuko Antagonists Ham Ghao says: "Minor Appa The Duke Haru Katara Sokka Teo Toph Ran and Shaw Sun Warriors Sun Warrior chief"
Katara says: "Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?"
Sokka says: "Right, got it ..."
Katara says: "Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?"
Sokka says: "Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket."
Katara says: "But what if it does rain?"
Sokka says: "What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing."
Katara says: "You're infuriating!"
Sokka says: "Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry."
Katara says: "Well, if you don't like my firewood-"
Sokka says: "Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job-"
Aang says: "Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the-  hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?"
Sokka says: "Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs."
Katara says: "Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the  Tents!"
Aang says: "Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?"
Katara says: "Sounds good."
Sokka says: "Whatever."
Aang says: "You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar.  Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs."
