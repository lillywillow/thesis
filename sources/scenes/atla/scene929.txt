Aang says: "Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere!"
Chong says: "Well not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs."
Aang says: "They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!"
Moku says: "On the way, there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow!"
Sokka says: "Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me."
Sokka says: "We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows."
Chong says: "Wow, sounds like someone has a case of destination fever. You're worried too much about where you're going."
Lily says: "You got to focus less on the "where" and more on the "going"."
Sokka says: "O. Ma. Shu!"
Katara says: "Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe."
Chong says: "Sounds like you're headed to Omashu."
Chong says: "There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains."
Katara says: "Is this real or a legend?"
Chong says: "Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself.  Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together!  Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes ...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!"
Sokka says: "I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine."
Aang says: "Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground.  And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ..."
