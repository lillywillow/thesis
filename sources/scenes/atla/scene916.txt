Zhang leader says: "Care for some meat?"
Sokka says: "Would I!"
Zhang leader says: "I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here."
Sokka says: "Hm-hmm."
Zhang leader says: "The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in."
Sokka says: "Hmm."
Zhang leader says: "Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years.  Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.  We Zhangs will never forget that injustice."
Sokka says: "That's just terrible.  You gonna finish that?"
Aang says: "Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts!  Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts."
Canyon guide says: "Lonely isn't it, being impartial?"
Aang says: "I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here."
Canyon guide says: "I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated."
