Suki says: "What is it? Did I do something wrong?"
Sokka says: "You mean you don't recognize me?"
Suki says: "You people all look the same to me."
Sokka says: "Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this."
Suki says: "Sokka!  It's you!"
Sokka says: "The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?"
Suki says: "No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader."
Sokka says: "Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out."
Suki says: "I'm so glad  to see you Sokka.  I knew you'd come."
