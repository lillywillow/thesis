Young Zuko says: "Let me in!"
Iroh says: "Prince Zuko, what's wrong?"
Young Zuko says: "I want to go into the war chamber  but the guard won't let me pass!"
Iroh says: "You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring."
Young Zuko says: "If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?"
Iroh says: "Very well. But you must promise not to speak.  These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?"
Young Zuko says: "Thank you, Uncle."
Bujing says: "The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.  A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division."
Elder soldier says: "But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?"
Bujing says: "I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?"
Young Zuko says: "You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?"
