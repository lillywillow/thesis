Koko says: "What's taking so long?"
Aang says: "I'm sure it will be here any second!  What about this?"
Little Girl says: "Not that again. Boring!"
Koko says: "Where's Unagi? It's getting late."
Aang says: "Where're you going? Don't leave!"
Koko says: "Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time."
Aang says: "Katara! You showed up!"
Katara says: "I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried."
Aang says: "Back there you acted like you didn't care."
Katara says: "I'm sorry."
Aang says: "Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk."
Katara says: "Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!"
Aang says: "On my way!"
Katara says: "Hang on, Aang!"
Katara says: "Aang!"
Katara says: "Zuko!"
Zuko says: "I want the Avatar alive."
