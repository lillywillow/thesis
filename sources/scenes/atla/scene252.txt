Hama says: "They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape."
Sokka says: "How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?"
Hama says: "I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore."
Katara says: "We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid."
Hama says: "Oh, you poor things."
Katara says: "I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero."
Hama says: "I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone."
Katara says: "Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me."
