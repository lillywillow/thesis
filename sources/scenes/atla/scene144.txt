Iroh says: "This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn  by the Crown Prince."
Katara says: "You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌?"
Toph says: "It's like these people are born bad."
Aang says: "No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all."
Sokka says: "Then what was the point?"
Aang says: "Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.  Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance.  And I also think it was about friendships."
Toph says: "Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?"
Aang says: "I don't see why not."
Sokka says: "Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ..."
Katara says: "Oh, Sokka, just hold hands."

Qin says: "This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us."
Ty Lee says: "Hmmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there?"
Qin says: "Please. The drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack."
Azula says: "Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin, but just to be on the safe side ...  Mai and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!"
Mai says: "Finally, something to do."
