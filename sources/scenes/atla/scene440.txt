Toph says: "You're blaming me for this?"
Aang says: "No! No, she's not blaming you."
Katara says: "No, I'm blaming her!"
Toph says: "Hey,  I never asked you for diddly-doo-dah.  I carry my own weight. Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's Sheddy over here!"
Aang says: "What? You're blaming Appa?"
Toph says: "Yeah, you want to know how they keep finding us?  He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!"
Aang says: "How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!"
Toph says: "I'm out of here."
Sokka says: "Wait!"
Aang says: "What did I just do?  I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone."
Katara says: "I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her."
Sokka says: "Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks."
Katara says: "Thanks, Sokka."
Sokka says: "No problem."
Katara says: "We need to find Toph and apologize."
Sokka says: "Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?"
Aang says: "I have a plan."
