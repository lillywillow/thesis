Aang says: "A lion turtle!  Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life.  But I don't know if I can do it."
Lion turtle says: "The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can tough the poison of hatred without being harmed.  Since beginningless time,  darkness thrives in the void but always yields to purifying light."
Lion turtle says: "Wait for him. He will come."
Ozai says: "It's time for this world to end in fire, and for a new world to be born from the ashes."
