Zuko says: "Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh."
Aang says: "I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem.  Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here!  But, I guess you can't see me either."
Katara says: "It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat."
Aang says: "What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?  Sokka?  That's definitely not Sokka.  What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World.  You don't know where Sokka is, do you?  You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?  I'll be back, Katara.  Take me to Roku!"
