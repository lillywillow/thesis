Aang says: "You've got something I want."
Sokka says: "That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at."
Mother Superior says: "The perfume?"
Iroh says: "June! No!"
Zuko says: "Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue."
Iroh says: "Shhh."
Aang says: "So ... where do we go?"
Katara says: "We're getting you to the North Pole."
Sokka says: "Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is."
Aang says: "Don't you want to see your father?"
Sokka says: "Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more."
Katara says: "And we need you."
Aang says: "I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ..."
Katara says: "I'll be okay."
Aang says: "Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like ...  this?"
Katara says: "Aang, how'd you get that?"
Aang says: "Zuko asked me to be sure I got it to you."
Katara says: "Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko. Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?"
Aang says: "Sure."
