Katara says: "I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here."
Aang says: "What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it."
Katara says: "Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph?"
Toph says: "As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'."
Katara says: "Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?"
Sokka says: "Why don't we ask the circle birds?"
Katara says: "Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to."
Katara says: "I think we should stop for the night."
Toph says: "Is there any more water?"
Katara says: "This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink."
Sokka says: "Momo, no! You've killed us all!"
Katara says: "No, he hasn't."
Sokka says: "Oh, right. Bending."
Katara says: "Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library."
Sokka says: "What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that?  It was you! You ratted me out!"
Katara says: "Sokka, I was there."
Aang says: "It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is."
Katara says: "No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us.  That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day."
Katara says: "Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours."
Zuko says: "No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers."
Iroh says: "So do we.  Ah, this is interesting. I think I found our friend."
Zuko says: "You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?"
Iroh says: "I don't think this is a gamble."
Xin Fu says: "Let's take them now!"
Yu says: "This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out we're collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience."
