Sokka says: "I think I know who you mean."
Aang says: "You do? And you're okay with it?"
Sokka says: "Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too."
Aang says: "She does?"
Sokka says: "Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up."
Aang says: "Well, how do I do that?"
Sokka says: "The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice."
Aang says: "You can be too nice?"
Sokka says: "Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other."
Aang says: "Well, okay ..."
Meng says: "Hey, Aang, I was wondering ..."
Aang says: "See you later ..."
Sokka says: "Wow, that kid is good."
