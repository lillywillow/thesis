Azula says: "Hey, beach bums, we're playing next.  Ty Lee, get over here, now!"
Azula says: "See that girl with the silly pigtails? When she runs toward the ball,  there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood injury has weakened her.  Keep serving the ball to her left, and we'll destroy her and the rest of her team.  Dismissed."
Azula says: "Yes! We defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation!  Well. That was fun."
Chan says: "I'm having a party tonight.  You should come by."
Ty Lee says: "Sure.  I love parties."
Ruon-Jian says: "Your friend can come, too."
Azula says: "Uh ... What about me and my brother? Aren't you going to invite us?  You don't know who we are, do you?"
Chan says: "Don't you know who we are? We're Chan and Ruon-Jian."
Ruon-Jian says: "Yeah."
Chan says: "But, fine, you're invited. Just so you know, though, some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party, so try and act normal."
Azula says: "We'll do our best."
