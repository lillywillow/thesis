Sokka says: "Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others."
Toph says: "Got it!"
Sokka says: "Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?"
Toph says: "You could stand to mention it more."
Sokka says: "My leg! Hang on Toph!"
Toph says: "Aye, aye, Captain."
Sokka says: "Bye, space sword."
Sokka says: "I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end."
Toph says: "How did that happen? Did boomerang come back?"
Sokka says: "No, Suki did."
