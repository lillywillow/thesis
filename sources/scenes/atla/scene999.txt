Sokka says: "I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother."
Zuko says: "Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village? Like what the lead ship looked like?"
Sokka says: "Yeah ... sea ravens.  The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them."
Zuko says: "The symbol of the Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka."
Sokka says: "No problem. Thanks for stopping by!  I'd thought he'd never leave.  Suki!"
Katara says: "You look terrible."
Zuko says: "I waited out here all night."
Katara says: "What do you want?"
Zuko says: "I know who killed your mother,  and I'm going to help you find him."
