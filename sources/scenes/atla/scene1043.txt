Chit Sang says: "Took you guys long enough.  This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too."
Sokka says: "Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go."
Zuko says: "Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance."
Suki says: "Your dad?"
Sokka says: "If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail."
Zuko says: "No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out."
Sokka says: "That supposed to make me feel better?"
Zuko says: "Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ..."
Sokka says: "Seriously, not helping."
Zuko says: "You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail."
Chit Sang says: "Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?"
Sokka says: "No. I'm staying. You guys go.  You've been here long enough."
Suki says: "I'm not leaving without you, Sokka."
Zuko says: "I'm staying, too."
Chit Sang says: "Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby."
Sokka says: "We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake."
Chit Sang says: "Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle."
Warden says: "Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners! Now!"
Sokka says: "The plan failed! They're caught!"
