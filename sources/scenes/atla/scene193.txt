Zuko says: "Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack."
Iroh says: "Somehow, that's not so surprising."
Zuko says: "I hope I made it the way you like it."
Iroh says: "Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing."
Zuko says: "So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her."
Iroh says: "No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down.  It's time to resume your training."
Katara says: "I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did."
Aang says: "Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle?"
Toph says: "No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ..."
Aang says: "Whoa!"
Katara says: "I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction."
Toph says: "Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.  Keep your knees high, Twinkle Toes!"
