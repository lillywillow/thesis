Sokka says: "So, Bumi ...  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?"
Bumi says: "Escape? I didn't escape. Everybody else escaped.  There I was back in Omashu,  waiting for just the right moment.  I didn't know what or when, but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.  An eclipse. That'll do it."
Firebender says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Bumi says: "Taking back my city! You've got no firepower. And it's payback time!"
Suki says: "Wow! You took back your whole city all by yourself!"
Bumi says: "So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse?"
Zuko says: "Nah."
Sokka says: "No, not really."
Aang says: "I need to look deep inside myself."
Kuruk says: "I am Avatar Kuruk.  When I was young, I was always a go-with-the-flow kind of Avatar.  People seemed to work out their own problems, and there was peace and good times in the world.  But then,  I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer.  It was my fault. If I had been more attentive and more active,  I could've saved her. Aang,  you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world."
