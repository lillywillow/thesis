Katara says: "So, how much for the, uh, traded scroll?"
Pirate captain says: "I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.  Unless of course, you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now."
Aang says: "I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle.  Watch and learn.  Let's say to the price of, one copper piece!"
Pirate captain says: "The price is two hundred gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare."
Aang says: "Okay, two copper pieces!"
Pirate captain says: "It's not as amusing the second time, boy!"
Katara says: "Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks."
Aang says: "Aye, we be casting off now!"
