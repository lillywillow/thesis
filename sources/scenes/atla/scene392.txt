Fong says: "Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at the North Pole.  I can't imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power. It's an awesome responsibility."
Aang says: "I try not to think about it too much."
Fong says: "Avatar, you're ready to face the Fire Lord now."
Aang says: "What? No I'm not!"
Katara says: "Aang still needs to master all four elements."
Fong says: "Why? With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now!"
Sokka says: "But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State."
Aang says: "See, it's this special state where-"
Fong says: "I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores.  But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation."
Aang says: "Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there."
Fong says: "So, it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and then you'll face your destiny."
Katara says: "No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way."
Fong says: "Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the War goes on. May I show you something?  That's the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones.  They came back. Every day, the Fire Nation takes lives. People are dying, Aang! You could end it, now. Think about it."
