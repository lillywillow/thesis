Sokka says: "Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.  In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?"
Southern Water Tribe boy says: "I gotta pee!"
Sokka says: "Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks!"
Southern Water Tribe boy says: "But I really gotta go!"
Sokka says: "Okay, who else has to go?"
Katara says: "Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago."
Aang says: "Wow! Everything freezes in there!"
Sokka says: "Uh!  Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only!"
Village boy says: "Whee!"
Sokka says: "Stop! Stop it right now!  What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War going on!"
Aang says: "What war? What are you talking about?"
Sokka says: "You're kidding, right?"
Aang says: "Penguin!"
Sokka says: "He's kidding, right?"
