Sokka says: "So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here!"
Aang says: "I can't."
Sokka says: "Sure you can! A little  swish-swish-swish!  Airbending slice!  And we're on our way!"
Katara says: "I think what "Master Swish" is trying to say  is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here."
Aang says: "I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence."
Sokka says: "How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago."
Aang says: "That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective."
Sokka says: "Well, I guess I could be classified as such."
Katara says: "Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky."
Sokka says: "Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots!  See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.  Okay, I guess I am pretty good."
Aang says: "So, you'll help me with my case?"
Sokka says: "Fine! But I'm going to need some new props.  I'm ready.  What?"
