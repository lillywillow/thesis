Dai Li agent says: "There's no war in Ba Sing Se."
Jet says: "What're you talking about?  Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it!"
Long Feng says: "In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia: the last one on Earth."
Dai Li agent says: "There is no war within the walls. Here we are safe. Here, we are free."
Katara says: "You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know."
Aang says: "I'll tell them! I'll make sure everyone knows!"
Long Feng says: "Until now, you've been treated as our honored guest.  But from now on, you will be watched every moment by Dai Li agents. If you mention the War to anyone, you will be expelled from the city.  I understand you've been looking for your bison.  It would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest.  Now, Joo Dee will show you to your home."
