Long Feng says: "I'm very disappointed in your work with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee. I had hoped that you would be able to control this situation."
Joo Dee says: "I am so sorry, but they don't trust me anymore.  I don't think I can keep working like this!"
Long Feng says: "Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai."
Joo Dee says: "I am honored to accept his invitation."
Long Feng says: "Good. Now go await further orders.  If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us control of the Earth King."
Dai Li agent says: "Should we take care of him?"
Long Feng says: "No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this quietly."
Iroh says: "So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it."
Zuko says: "The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and he's lost his bison."
Iroh says: "We have a chance for a new life here.  If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us."
Zuko says: "Good things that are happening for you! Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?"
Iroh says: "There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why."
Zuko says: "I want my destiny."
Iroh says: "What that means is up to you.  The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid."
