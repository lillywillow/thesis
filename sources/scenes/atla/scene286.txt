Aang says: "Okay, you caught me.  I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out.  No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody!  Love each other,  respect all life,  and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!"
Katara says: "You can't keep us here! Let us leave!"
Bumi says: "Lettuce leaf?"
Sokka says: "We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts."
Bumi says: "Tomorrow, the Avatar will  face three deadly challenges.  But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber."
Chamberlain says: "My liege, do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber?"
Bumi says: "The newly refurbished chamber."
Chamberlain says: "Wait, which one are we talking about?"
Bumi says: "The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing, that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them.  Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!"
