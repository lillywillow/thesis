Aang says: "You trained the Dai Li? But they're the worst, most corrupt Earthbenders in the world!"
Kyoshi says: "I thought I was doing the right thing by creating a group that protected cultural history. I had no idea what they would become. Aang, our actions always have an effect: sometimes positive, sometimes negative ... and sometimes not for many lifetimes.  Hurry! You must find the Waterbender Avatar who came before me."
Aang says: "But I don't even know his name!"
Kyoshi says: "His name is Avatar Kuruk."
Aang says: "We're in the Realm of Koh, Hei Bai ... We better be careful.  Aaahh!  Koh took your face and replaced it with a bear's face!"
Kuruk says: "Relax kid. I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm Avatar Kuruk! Nice to finally meet you. Now tell me, have you seen a beautiful woman with long, brown hair around here?"
Aang says: "No, who is she?"
Kuruk says: "She's my wife.  When I was a young Avatar ...  ... I traveled the world, challenging other benders to tests of strength ..."
Kuruk says: "I challenge you to an Agni Kai!"
Fire Nation civilian says: "Uh, I was just going to the store."
