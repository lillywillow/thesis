Gate guard says: "Rotten cabbages?!  What kind of slum do you think this is?!"
Cabbage merchant says: "No! My cabbages!"
Aang says: "Just keep smiling!"
Gate guard says: "State your business!"
Aang says: "My business is my business, young man,  and none of yours!  I've got half a mind to  bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!"
Gate guard says: "Settle down, old timer! Just tell me who you are."
Aang says: "Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third,  and these are my grandkids."
Katara says: "Hi. June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis. Nice to meet you."
Gate guard says: "You seem like a responsible young lady. See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!"
Katara says: "We will!"
Gate guard says: "Wait a minute!  You're a strong young boy! Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag!"
Aang says: "Good idea!"
