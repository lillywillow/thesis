Aang says: "Why are we doing this?"
Sokka says: "Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be."
Aang says: "You can't possibly check every single date."
Sokka says: "I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that."
Aang says: "Come on, eclipse."
