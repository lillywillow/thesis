Aang says: "So you were just gonna take Appa anyway?"
Katara says: "Yes."
Aang says: "It's okay, because I forgive you.  That give you any ideas?"
Katara says: "Don't try to stop us."
Aang says: "I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man.  But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him."
Zuko says: "Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody."
Katara says: "Thanks for understanding, Aang. Yip-yip."
Sokka says: "You know, you're pretty wise for a kid."
Aang says: "Thanks, Sokka."
Sokka says: "Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed."
Aang says: "I appreciate that."
Sokka says: "So, can I borrow Momo for a week?"
Aang says: "Why do you need Momo?"
