Piandao says: "The warrior practices a variety of arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.  The first you will learn is calligraphy.  Write your name."
Sokka says: "Writing my name will make me a better swordsmanâ€Œ?"
Piandao says: "When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield.  Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword."
Piandao says: "You are getting ink on your face."
Sokka says: "I am?  I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?"
