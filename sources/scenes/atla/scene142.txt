Sozin says: "With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world.  I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples.  But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me.  I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain.  I know he's hiding out there somewhere.  The Fire Nation's greatest threat ... the last airbender."
Zuko says: "That can't be it! Where's the rest of it?"
