Katara says: "I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now.  Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay."
Katara says: "What's going on?"
Sokka says: "The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!"
Sokka says: "Good ... bird ... horse thingy ..."
Fong says: "Maybe you can avoid me ... but she can't."
Katara says: "I can't move!"
Aang says: "Don't hurt her!"
Sokka says: "Katara! No!"
Aang says: "Stop this! You have to let her go!"
Fong says: "You could save her if you were in the Avatar State!"
Aang says: "I'm trying ... I'm trying!"
Katara says: "Aang, I'm sinking!"
Fong says: "I don't see glowing!"
Katara says: "Please!"
Aang says: "You don't need to do this!"
Fong says: "Apparently, I do."
Fong says: "It worked! It worked!"
