Zuko says: "You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know! The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end."
Iroh says: "No, he wasn't."
Zuko says: "What are you talking about?"
Iroh says: "You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather.  Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku."
Zuko says: "Why are you telling me this?"
Iroh says: "Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself.  Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side.  What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world."
