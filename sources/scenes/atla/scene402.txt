Zuko says: "We're going home! After three long years, it's unbelievable!"
Iroh says: "It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything."
Zuko says: "Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him!  He cares about me!"
Iroh says: "I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine."
Zuko says: "You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything!"
Iroh says: "Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem."
Zuko says: "I think you are exactly what you seem! A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who's always been jealous of his brother!"
Aang says: "Sokka! Sokka, wake up."
Sokka says: "Huh?"
Aang says: "I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State."
Sokka says: "You sure?"
Aang says: "Yes."
Sokka says: "Okay."
Aang says: "Do you think the general will be mad?"
Sokka says: "What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?"
Iroh says: "Wait! Don't leave without me!"
Zuko says: "Uncle! You've changed your mind!"
Iroh says: "Family sticks together, right?"
