Iroh says: "There is a storm coming. A big one."
Zuko says: "You're out of your mind, Uncle.  The weather's perfect. There's not a cloud in sight."
Iroh says: "A storm is approaching from the north.  I suggest we alter our course and head southwest."
Zuko says: "We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same."
Iroh says: "Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew."
Zuko says: "The safety of the crew doesn't matter!"
Zuko says: "Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety."
Iroh says: "He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up."
