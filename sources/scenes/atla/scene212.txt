Earthbender captain says: "What's the problem?"
Iroh says: "Nothing.  Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose."
Earthbender captain says: "Too loose?"
Iroh says: "That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much."
Earthbender captain says: "Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs."
Aang says: "Hey, what are you doing?  I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku.  Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?  It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?  But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now!"
