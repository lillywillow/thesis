Zuko says: "Please. The real hero is the Avatar.  Today this war is finally over!  I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation. And I will.  The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided.  But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace."
Fire Sage says: "All hail Fire Lord Zuko!"
