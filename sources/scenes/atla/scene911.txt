Aang says: "Wow."
Zuko says: "I understand."
Zuko says: "Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined."
Aang says: "Like firebending harmony."
Sun Warrior chief says: "Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending."
Zuko says: "I can't believe there are still living dragons. My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it."
Aang says: "So your uncle lied."
Sun Warrior chief says: "Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters.  They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well."
Zuko says: "He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them."
Aang says: "All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life."
Zuko says: "Yeah. It's like the Sun,  but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?"
Sun Warrior chief says: "Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah."
Zuko says: "That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you  was my drive ... it was my purpose.  So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive.  I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world."
Sun Warrior chief says: "Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence,  we have no choice but to imprison you here forever.  Just kidding.  But seriously, don't tell anyone!"
