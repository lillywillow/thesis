Ukano says: "I apologize.  You've come to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon we're making a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back."
Azula says: "Yes, I'm so sorry to hear about your son, but really,  what did you expect by just letting all the citizens leave?  My father has trusted you with this city and you're making a mess of things!"
Ukano says: "Forgive me, Princess."
Azula says: "You stay here.  Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up.  And there is no more "Omashu". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the city of New Ozai."
King Bumi says: "Hi, everybody!"
Mai says: "You brought my brother?"
Aang says: "He's here. We're ready to trade."
Azula says: "I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind?"
Mai says: "Of course not, Princess Azula."
Azula says: "We're trading a two year old for a king.  A powerful, earthbending king?"
King Bumi says: "Mmm hmmm!"
Azula says: "It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it?"
Mai says: "You're right.  The deal's off."
King Bumi says: "Whhhoa! See you all later!"
