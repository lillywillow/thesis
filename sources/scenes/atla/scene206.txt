Aang says: "No.  Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up?"
Sokka says: "Cheered me up.  Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that."
Katara says: "These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back."
Aang says: "Thanks, Katara."
Sokka says: "Hey, who are you?"
Kay-fon says: "When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible!  But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child?  My village desperately needs your help!"
