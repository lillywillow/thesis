Ham Ghao says: "Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves,  here to steal Sun Warrior treasures."
Aang says: "Please, I don't normally play this card, but ...  I'm the Avatar.  Just hear us out."
Zuko says: "My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.  O-or at least I used to be.  I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way,  the original way. When we came here, I never imagined  the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence.  Please, teach us."
Sun Warrior chief says: "If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters, Ran and Shaw."
Aang says: "Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?"
Sun Warrior chief says: "When you present yourself to them, they will examine you.  They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry.  If they deem you worthy, they'll teach you.  If they don't, you'll be destroyed on the spot."
