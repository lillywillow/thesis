Azula says: "Hello, Zuzu. If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait."
Zuko says: "So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh? And apparently I'm not welcome there."
Azula says: "What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there!"
Zuko says: "Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it!"
Azula says: "Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so obvious you're supposed to be there."
Zuko says: "Well, were you invited?"
Azula says: "Of course! I'm the princess."
Zuko says: "And I'm the prince!"
Azula says: "Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting."
Zuko says: "Forget it! I'm not going!"
