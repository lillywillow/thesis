Aang says: "Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds."
Toph says: "Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it."
Sokka says: "We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope."
Aang says: "Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow!"
Katara says: "Aang ..."
Aang says: "No, Katara! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me!"
Katara says: "I'm not going to hit you."
Toph says: "You want me to do it?"
Katara says: "Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met.  I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough."
Aang says: "You really think so?"
Sokka says: "We all do. You can do this. You're ready."
Toph says: "You're the man, Twinkle Toes!"
Aang says: "Thanks, guys.  You know what? I think I am ready.  Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!"
Ozai says: "Really? You're gonna take me out? You're not even wearing pants!"
Aang says: "No, Fire Lord Ozai. You're not wearing any pants."
Ozai says: "No! My royal parts are showing."
