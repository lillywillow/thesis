Katara says: "Why do you guys live on the river?"
Dock says: "Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in.  Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river.  Now our little village is struggling to survive."
Aang says: "Thanks for the ride!"
Katara says: "Look at this place.  It's so sad.  We have to do something to help."
Sokka says: "No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own."
Katara says: "These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them?  How can you be so cold and heartless?"
Sokka says: "I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord."
Toph says: "Hey, loud mouths! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about  "taking out the Fire Lord.""
Sokka says: "Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first."
Katara says: "I guess so."
Aang says: "Let's just get what we need and go."
