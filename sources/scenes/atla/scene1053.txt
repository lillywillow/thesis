Sokka says: "Can't you watch where you're ..."
Toph says: "No."
Sokka says: "Right. Sorry."
Katara says: "Come on guys, we've got to stick together."
Sokka says: "If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem."
Toph says: "Katara, can I have some more water?"
Katara says: "Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it."
Sokka says: "We're drinking your bending water.  You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!"
Toph says: "It does taste swampy."
Katara says: "I'm sorry, it's all we have."
Sokka says: "Not anymore! Look!"
Katara says: "Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!"
Sokka says: "There's water trapped inside these!"
Katara says: "I don't know ..."
Sokka says: "Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though."
Sokka says: "Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.  It's the quenchiest!"
Katara says: "Okay, I think you've had enough."
Sokka says: "Who lit Toph on fire?"
Toph says: "Can I get some of that cactus?"
Katara says: "I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang."
Sokka says: "How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?"
