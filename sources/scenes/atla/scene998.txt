Suki says: "Oops, wrong tent!"
Zuko says: "Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too?"
Suki says: "Nope, not me!"
Sokka says: "Well, hello ...  Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different?  So what's on your mind?"
Zuko says: "Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me."
Sokka says: "Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.  No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!"
Zuko says: "Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother."
Sokka says: "What? Why would you want to know that?"
Zuko says: "Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me."
Sokka says: "It's not a day I like to remember."
Young Katara says: "I'm going to find Mom!"
Sokka says: "Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid.  We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left."
