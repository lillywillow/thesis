Old man says: "Help, help!"
Haru says: "The mine!"
Old man says: "Help me!"
Katara says: "Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help!"
Haru says: "There's no time, pull harder!"
Katara says: "Haru. There's a way you can help him."
Haru says: "I can't."
Katara says: "Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way!"
Katara says: "Haru! You did it!"
Katara says: "It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man."
Aang says: "You must have really inspired him."
Katara says: "I guess so."
Sokka says: "Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn."
Katara says: "Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?"
Sokka says: "Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight."
Katara says: "I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts."
Sokka says: "Goodnight!"
Old man says: "That's him! That's the earthbender!"
Katara says: "They took him! They took Haru away!"
Aang says: "What?"
Katara says: "The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending!"
Sokka says: "Slow down, Katara. When did this happen?"
Katara says: "Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight."
Sokka says: "Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone."
Katara says: "We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru."
Aang says: "And ... why would they do that?"
Katara says: "Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending."
