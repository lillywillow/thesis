Zuko says: "So far, this intermission is the best part of the play."
Sokka says: "Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!"
Suki says: "Yeah, you tell bad jokes about plenty of other topics."
Sokka says: "I know!"
Aang says: "At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you.  That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!"
Toph says: "I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys."
Aang says: "Argh!"
Katara says: "Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.  What?"
Aang says: "Yeah, that's not you at all."
Toph says: "Listen friends, it's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt, but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth."
Actress Katara says: "Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom!"
Actress Aang says: "I'd better have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher!"
Toph says: "This is it, this must be where I come in!"
Actress Aang says: "I flew all over town, but I couldn't find a single earthbending master!"
Toph says: "Here it comes ..."
Actor Toph says: "You can't find an earthbending master in the sky, you have to look underground!"
Actress Aang says: "Who are you?"
Actor Toph says: "My name's Toph,  because it sounds like tough, and that's just what I am!"
Toph says: "Wait a minute,   I sound like a guy. A really buff guy."
Katara says: "Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?"
Toph says: "Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have cast it any other way!  At least it's not a flying bald lady!"
Actress Aang says: "So, you're blind?"
Actor Toph says: "I can see you doing that. I see everything that you see, except I don't "see" like you do. I release a sonic wave from my mouth.  There. I got a pretty good look at you."
