General Sung says: "It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar, but your help is not needed."
Aang says: "Not needed?"
General Sung says: "Not needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded."
Toph says: "What about the Dragon of the West? He got in."
General Sung says: "Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged.  Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the "impenetrable city". They don't call it Na Sing Se.  That means "penetrable city.""
Toph says: "Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem."
General Sung says: "Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team."
Sokka says: "That's a good group name. Very catchy."
