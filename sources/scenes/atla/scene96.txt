Aang says: "So, this is it huh?"
Sokka says: "Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive?"
Aang says: "I'm ready."
Toph says: "I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes."
Hakoda says: "Everyone listen up.  The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs."
Aang says: "Katara, I ..."
Katara says: "Aang, I ..."
Aang says: "You go first."
Katara says: "We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you."
Aang says: "Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it."
Katara says: "Yes, it is."
Aang says: "What if ... what if I don't come back?"
Katara says: "Aang, don't say that, of course you'll-"
Sokka says: "Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge."
Katara says: "What? Right, I'm on it."
