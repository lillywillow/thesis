Aang says: "Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?"
Zuko says: "If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you."
Katara says: "Ha, ha."
Sokka says: "To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero?"
Team Avatar says: "Hear! Hear!"
Zuko says: "I'm touched.  I don't deserve this."
Katara says: "Yeah, no kidding."
Sokka says: "What's with her?"
Zuko says: "I wish I knew."
