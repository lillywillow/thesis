Sokka says: "C'mon brace ... budge!"
Katara says: "This is bad, really bad."
Sokka says: "We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!"
Aang says: "Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike.  Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance.  And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.  His own weight becomes his downfall, literally."
Katara says: "So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through."
Aang says: "Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow."
Sokka says: "And boom! It all comes crashing down!"
Aang says: "Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us."
Sokka says: "The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is."
