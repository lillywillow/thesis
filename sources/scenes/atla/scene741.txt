Iroh says: "Looks like you did some serious shopping.  But where did you get the money?"
Zuko says: "Do you like your new teapot?"
Iroh says: "To be honest with you , the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.  I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by.  But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty."
Zuko says: "There's no honor for me without the Avatar."
Iroh says: "Zuko ...  Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now."
Zuko says: "Then there is no hope at all."
Iroh says: "No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.  In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength."
Katara says: "Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony."
Tong says: "I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses!"
Katara says: "This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ...  Avatar Kyoshi herself!"
Sokka says: "What are you doing?"
Katara says: "Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something."
Sokka says: "I do believe in the power of stuff."
Tong says: "This is a mockery of Chin Law!"
Katara says: "Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!"
Aang says: "Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here."
Tong says: "This is ridiculous!  For the murder of Chin the Great, this court finds the Avatarâ€“"
Kyoshi says: "I killed Chin the Conqueror.  A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent."
