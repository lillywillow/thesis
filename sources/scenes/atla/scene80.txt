Aang says: "Katara, did you really mean what you said in there?"
Katara says: "In where? What are you talking about?"
Aang says: "On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me."
Katara says: "I didn't say that. An actor said that."
Aang says: "But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not."
Katara says: "Aang, I don't know."
Aang says: "Why don't you know?"
Katara says: "Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time."
Aang says: "Well, when is the right time?"
Katara says: "Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused."
Katara says: "I just said I was confused! I'm going inside."
Aang says: "Ugh, I'm such an idiot!"
Sokka says: "Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!"
