Aang says: "Katara? Are you okay?"
Katara says: "I'm doing fine."
Aang says: "Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you."
Katara says: "I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to."
Aang says: "You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing."
Katara says: "But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him.  But I am ready to forgive you."
Zuko says: "You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer."
Aang says: "It never is."
Zuko says: "Then I have a question for you.  What are you gonna do when you face my father?"
