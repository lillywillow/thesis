Zhao says: "You're alive?"
Zuko says: "You tried to have me killed!"
Zhao says: "Yes I did.  You're the Blue Spirit, an enemy of the Fire Nation! You freed the Avatar."
Zuko says: "I had no choice."
Zhao says: "You should have chosen to accept your failure; you're a disgrace. Then, at least, you could have lived!"
Katara says: "It's too late, it's dead."
Iroh says: "You have been touched by the Moon Spirit.  Some of its life is in you."
Yue says: "Yes, you're right. It gave me life, maybe I can give it back."
Sokka says: "No! You don't have to do that."
Yue says: "It's my duty, Sokka."
Sokka says: "I won't let you!  Your father told me to protect you."
Yue says: "I have to do this."
Sokka says: "No! She's gone, she's gone."
