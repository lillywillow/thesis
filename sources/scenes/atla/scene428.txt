Toph says: "Ah, land sweet land!  See you guys in the morning!"
Katara says: "Actually, can you help us unload?"
Toph says: "Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?"
Katara says: "Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -"
Toph says: "Look! I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff!  I'm carrying my own weight."
Katara says: "That's not the point.  Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!"
Toph says: "What? Look here, sugar queen,  I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!"
Katara says: ""Sugar queen"?!Â  D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?!"
