Aang says: "But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?"
Gyatso says: "Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey."
Aang says: "Who is it?"
Gyatso says: "When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you.  Now, are you going to help me with these cakes,  or not?"
Aang says: "All right."
