Sokka says: "Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me."
Suki says: "I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth.  I think I could get you backstage!"
Toph says: "Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something!"
Zuko says: "You don't get it, it's different for you. You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks."
Toph says: "Yeah, that's pretty great!"
Zuko says: "But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face. My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad. He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself."
Toph says: "You have redeemed yourself to your uncle. You don't realize it, but you already have."
Zuko says: "How do you know?"
Toph says: "Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you."
Zuko says: "Really?"
Toph says: "Yeah, and it was kind of annoying."
Zuko says: "Oh, sorry."
Toph says: "But it was also very sweet. All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud."
Zuko says: "Ow! What was that for?"
Toph says: "That's how I show affection."
Young boy says: "Your Zuko costume's pretty good, but your scar's on the wrong side."
Zuko says: "The scar's not on the wrong side!"
