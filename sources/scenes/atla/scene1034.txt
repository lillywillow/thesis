Jeong Jeong says: "You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse."
Katara says: "But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know."
Jeong Jeong says: "Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart."
Jeong Jeong says: "Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!"
Zhao says: "Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.  Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong?"
Sokka says: "Katara! Are you all right?"
Katara says: "I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?"
Aang says: "Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again."
Katara says: "You'll have to eventually."
Aang says: "No, never again."
Katara says: "It's okay, Aang. I'm healed."
Aang says: "What? How?"
Katara says: "I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!"
Aang says: "Where?"
Katara says: "By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong."
Aang says: "I have to help him!"
Zhao says: "Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage."
Jeong Jeong says: "It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao."
Zhao says: "It's Admiral Zhao, now."
Jeong Jeong says: "That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!"
Zhao says: "I think I can handle a child."
Jeong Jeong says: "I have never seen such raw power ..."
Aang says: "Jeong Jeong!"
Zhao says: "We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!"
