Aang says: "The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!"
Katara says: "Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders."
Aang says: "What about 'em?"
Katara says: "Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless.  They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people."
Aang says: "Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!"
Katara says: "I know it's hard to accept."
Aang says: "You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison!  Right, Appa?"
Aang says: "Yip yip!"
Aang says: "There it is. The Southern Air Temple."
Katara says: "Aang, it's amazing!"
Aang says: "We're home, buddy! We're home."
