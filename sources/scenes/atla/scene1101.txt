Katara says: "I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father."
Haru says: "That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him."
Katara says: "Thanks."
Haru says: "My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway."
Katara says: "He sounds like a great man."
Haru says: "After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away.  We haven't seen them since."
Katara says: "So that's why you hide your earthbending."
Haru says: "Yeah. Problem is ...  the only way I can feel close to my father now  is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know."
Katara says: "See this necklace? My mother gave it to me."
Haru says: "It's beautiful."
Katara says: "I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid.  This necklace is all I have left of her."
Haru says: "It's not enough, is it?"
Katara says: "No."
