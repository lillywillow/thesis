Chit Sang says: "Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going!"
Zuko says: "Hey, you watch who you're shoving!"
Chit Sang says: "I think you mean whom I'm shoving!"
Sokka says: "I need backup over here!"
Male guard says: "No firebending!  Into the cooler!"
Sokka says: "I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson."
Zuko says: "Yes, I have ... completely."
Sokka says: "I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore."
Zuko says: "Someone's coming!"
Male guard says: "Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn."
Female guard says: "Anybody interesting?"
Male guard says: "Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners,  though I did hear there might be a pirate."
Female guard says: "No fooling!"
Zuko says: "War prisoners. It could be your father."
Sokka says: "I know."
Zuko says: "Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?"
Sokka says: "I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?"
Zuko says: "It's your call, Sokka."
