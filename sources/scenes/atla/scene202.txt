Zuko says: "Azula always lies."
Sela says: "You have to help! It's Lee – the thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left. When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them! I don't even know where he got a knife! Then they took him away.  They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army. I know we barely know you, but ..."
Zuko says: "I'll get your son back."
Lee says: "Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come!"
Zuko says: "Let the kid go."
Gow says: "Who do you think you are, telling us what to do?"
Zuko says: "It doesn't matter who I am. But I know who you are. You're not soldiers; you're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army – you're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war."
Gow says: "Are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?"
Old man says: "Give him a left! A left!"
Old woman says: "It's not a fistfight ..."
Old man says: "He's got a left sword, don't he?"
Old man says: "Look out!"
Lee says: "Behind you!"
Young Zuko says: "... Mom?"
Ursa says: "Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you."
Ursa says: "Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are."
Lee says: "Get up ...!"
Gow says: "Who ... who are you?"
Zuko says: "My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne."
Old man says: "Liar! I heard of you! You're not a prince, you're an outcast! His own father burned and disowned him!"
Sela says: "Not a step closer."
Zuko says: "It's yours. You should have it."
Lee says: "No! I hate you!"
Young Zuko says: "Mom?  Mom? Mom!"
Young Zuko says: "Where's Mom?"
Young Azula says: "No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away."
Young Zuko says: "Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now."
Young Azula says: "Who's going to make me? Mom?"
Young Zuko says: "Where is she?"
