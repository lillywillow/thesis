Aang says: "It's a hexagon.  It doesn't seem like normal rock.  It's not made of earth.  This is so strange.  I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku.  I do have Roku!"
Avatar Roku says: "You're right, Aang.  All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom, is available to you  if you look deep inside yourself."
Aang says: "So where am I, Roku? What is this place?"
Avatar Roku says: "I ... don't know, Aang.  But I see you are lost in more ways than one right now."
Aang says: "I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord."
Toph says: "Huh?"
Bumi says: "Well, look who's here!"
