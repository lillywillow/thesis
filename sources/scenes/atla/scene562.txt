Mai says: "You need some help with that?"
Zuko says: "Mai! You're okay! They let you out of prison?"
Mai says: "My uncle pulled some strings. And it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend."
Zuko says: "So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?"
Mai says: "I think it means I actually kind of like you.  But don't ever break up with me again!"
Katara and Sokka says: "Dad!"
Hakoda says: "I heard what you two did. I am the proudest father in the world.  And your mother would be proud, too."
Sokka says: "There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?"
Ty Lee says: "It feels great!"
Sokka says: "Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again."
Suki says: "It's okay. She's one of us now."
Ty Lee says: "Yeah, the girls and I really bonded in prison. And after a few chi blocking lessons, they said I could join their group. We're going to be best friends forever."
