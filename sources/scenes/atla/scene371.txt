Sokka says: "Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do me next."
Katara says: "This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away.  Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right."
Aang says: "Like this?"
Katara says: "That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventuallyâ€”"
Aang says: "Hey, I'm bending it already!"
Katara says: "Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move."
Aang says: "Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher."
Katara says: "Thanks."
Aang says: "So, what's next?"
Katara says: "This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water.  It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if-  Nice work.  Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary."
Aang says: "Sorry.  Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming!"
Katara says: "Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave."
Aang says: "So, like this?"
Sokka says: "Aang?!"
Aang says: "Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?"
Katara says: "That's enough practicing for today."
Sokka says: "Yeah, I'll say!  You just "practiced" our supplies down the river."
Aang says: "Uh, sorry.  I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff."
Sokka says: "My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender."
