Katara says: "This should bring your fever down."
Sokka says: "You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor."
Katara says: "That's nice. I'll tell him."
Sokka says: "Classic Appa."
Aang says: "How's Sokka doing?"
Katara says: "Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him."
Aang says: "I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there."
Katara says: "Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow."
Aang says: "Not you too!"
Katara says: "Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi-"
Aang says: "That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender!"
Sokka says: "Take that, you rock!"
Aang says: "A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine!  Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.  Keep an eye on them guys."
Sokka says: "Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!"
