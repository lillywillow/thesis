Toph says: "What's going on?"
Aang says: "Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!"
Sokka says: "What did you do?"
Katara says: "I kind of destroyed their factory."
Sokka says: "You what?"
Katara says: "It was your idea!"
Sokka says: "I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises!  Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge!"
Katara says: "Well, what was I supposed to do?"
Sokka says: "Leave! Do nothing!"
Katara says: "No, I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me!  I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can."
Sokka says: "Wait! I'm coming, too."
Katara says: "I thought you didn't want to help."
Sokka says: "You need me, and I will never turn my back on you."
Katara says: "Sokka, you really do have a heart."
Aang says: "He really does have a heart, doesn't he?"
Mung says: "I thought we could live as neighbors, in peace. But I guess I was wrong. You steal our food, our medicine ... and then you destroy our factory."
Dock/Xu says: "We didn't do any of that.  Yeah, the Painted Lady brought us food. She's the one that healed our sick, not your medicine."
Mung says: "Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady did it. And I suppose she drew the army emblem on your containers, too.  This is a town of thieves and liars!  Where's your Painted Lady now? We're going to cure the world of this wretched village."
Mung says: "Light it again!"
Female Fire Nation soldier says: "Look at that! Where's it coming from?"
