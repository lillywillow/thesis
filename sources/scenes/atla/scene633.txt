Arnook says: "Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms."
Hahn says: "What's your problem?"
Sokka says: "Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that."
Hahn says: "Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers."
Sokka says: "When, like, a hundred years ago?"
Arnook says: "Eighty-five."
Sokka says: "The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined."
Hahn says: "How do we know we can trust this guy?  Such bold talk for a new recruit."
Arnook says: "Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn. He's a capable warrior and I value his input.  Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer."
Sokka says: "His name is Zhao. Middle-aged,  big sideburns, bigger temper ..."
Arnook says: "Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect.  I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law."
Sokka says: "Princess Yue's marrying you?"
Hahn says: "Yeah, what of it?"
Sokka says: "Nothing. Congratulations."
