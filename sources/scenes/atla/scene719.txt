Iroh says: "Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname "The Dragon of the West"?"
Azula says: "I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle."
Iroh says: "It's more of a demonstration, really."
Iroh says: "Come on! You'll be fine!"
Zuko says: "No! I'm tired of running! It's time I faced Azula!"
Azula says: "You're so dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai?"
Zuko says: "Yes! I challenge you!"
Azula says: "No thanks."
