Young Zuko says: "Hey Mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?"
Ursa says: "Zuko! Why would you do that?"
Young Zuko says: "Ow! Ow ow! Ouch!"
Young Zuko says: "Stupid turtle duck. Why she'd do that?"
Ursa says: "Zuko. That's what moms are like.  If you mess with their babies,, they're gonna bite you back!"
Young Ty Lee says: "Ugh! Azula!"
Young Azula says: "Watch this!  Mom! Can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game!"
Young Zuko says: "I am not cart-wheeling."
Young Azula says: "You won't have to.  Cart-wheeling's not a game, dum-dum."
Young Zuko says: "I don't care. I don't want to play with you!"
Young Azula says: "We are brother and sister. It's important for us to spend time together! Don't you think so, Mom?"
Ursa says: "Yes, darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister.  Go on now, just for a little while."
Young Azula says: "Here's the way it goes.  Now what you do is, try to knock the apple off the other person's head, like this."
Young Azula says: "See, I told you it would work!"
