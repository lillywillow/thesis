Zuko says: "For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.  My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai.  How could you possibly justify a duel with a child?"
Ozai says: "It was to teach you respect!"
Zuko says: "It was cruel! And it was wrong."
Ozai says: "Then you have learned nothing!"
Zuko says: "No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it!  We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself , we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness."
Ozai says: "Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?"
Zuko says: "Yes.  He has."
