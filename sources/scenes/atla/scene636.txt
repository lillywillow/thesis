Iroh says: "If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape."
Zuko says: "I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle."
Iroh says: "I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well,  ever since I lost my son ..."
Zuko says: "Uncle, you don't have to say it."
Iroh says: "... I think of you as my own."
Zuko says: "I know, Uncle. We'll meet again.  After I have the Avatar."
Iroh says: "Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there."
Zuko says: "I will."
Iroh says: "And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!"
Zuko says: "I'll be fine!"
Hahn says: "Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks."
Sokka says: "Perks? What does that mean?"
Hahn says: "I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either."
Sokka says: "Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!"
Hahn says: "Whoa, hang on. What do you care?  You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life?  No offense."
Sokka says: "You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense!"
Arnook says: "That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission!"
Hahn says: "All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Ch≈ç in no time!"
Sokka says: "It's Admiral Zhao!"
