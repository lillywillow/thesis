Aang says: "Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world!"
Katara says: "Aang, I know you're excited,  but it's been a hundred years since you've been home."
Aang says: "That's why I'm so excited!"
Katara says: "It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time."
Aang says: "I know, but I need to see it for myself."
Aang says: "Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come!"
Sokka says: "Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later."
Aang says: "Sokka! Wake up!  There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!"
Sokka says: "Ahh!  Get it off! Get it off!  Ahh!"
Aang says: "Great! You're awake! Let's go!"
