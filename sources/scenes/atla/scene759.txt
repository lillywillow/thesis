Mai says: "Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?"
Zuko says: "I don't."
Mai says: "Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even want to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to."
Zuko says: "I know."
Mai says: "You know what will make you feel better?  Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time."
