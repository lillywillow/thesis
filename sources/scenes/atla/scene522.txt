Aang says: "Hang on, Momo!  All right, you too."
Sokka says: "This is gonna take forever."
Aang says: "That works."
Sokka says: "These are Fire Nation traps,  you can tell from the metalwork. We better pack up camp, and get moving."
Sokka says: "Uh uh. No flying this time."
Aang says: "What? Why wouldn't we fly?"
Sokka says: "Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable."
Katara says: "What? Appa's not too noticeable!"
Sokka says: "He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him!"
Aang says: "Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow."
Sokka says: "I know you all wanna fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk."
Katara says: "Who made you the boss?"
Sokka says: "I'm not the boss, I'm the leader."
Katara says: "You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!"
Sokka says: "I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so  I'm the leader!"
Katara says: "If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean he is the Avatar."
Sokka says: "Are you kidding, he's just a goofy kid!"
Aang says: "He's right."
Katara says: "Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl."
Sokka says: "I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her."
Katara says: "Who? Gran-Gran? I've met Gran-Gran."
Sokka says: "No! Besides Gran-Gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot, and a leader has to trust his instincts."
Katara says: "Okay, we'll try it your way, oh wise leader."
Aang says: "Who knows? Walking might be fun.  Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?"
Katara says: "Well I don't know, Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts? They seem to know everything."
Sokka says: "Ha, ha, very funny."
Aang says: "I'm tired of carrying this pack."
Katara says: "You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts."
Aang says: "That's a great idea. Hey, Sokka's instincts, would you mind-"
Sokka says: "Okay, okay, I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that we're safe from the  Fire ... Nation."
Sokka says: "Run!  We're cut off!"
Aang says: "Sokka, your shirt!"
Sokka says: "If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you."
Katara says: "What are you doing?"
Sokka says: "Bluffing?"
Eye-patch soldier says: "You promise not to hurt us?"
Aang says: "Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that?"
Sokka says: "Uh, instinct?"
Katara says: "Look!"
Jet says: "Down you go."
Fire Nation soldier says: "They're in the trees!"
Sokka says: "Hey, he was mine!"
Jet says: "Gotta be quicker next time."
Sokka says: "Man!"
Jet says: "Hey."
Katara says: "Hi."
Aang says: "You just took out a whole army almost single-handed."
Sokka says: "Army? There were only like, twenty guys."
Jet says: "My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee, The Duke, and Pipsqueak."
Aang says: "Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name."
Pipsqueak says: "You think my name is funny?"
Aang says: "It's hilarious!"
