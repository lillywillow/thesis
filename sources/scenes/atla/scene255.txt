Aang says: "Old Man Ding?"
Ding says: "Huh?  Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old!  Well, I'm young at heart."
Ding says: "Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least."
Sokka says: "We wanted to ask you about that."
Aang says: "Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?"
Ding says: "Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain.  I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there.  And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light.  But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!"
Sokka says: "Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?"
Toph says: "Oh no!  I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there!"
