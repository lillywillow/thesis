Katara says: "I guess that's me."
Sokka says: "Mm, not bad, not bad!  Mhm?"
Aang says: "I'm good on puffs.  So, what do you think they're talking about back there?"
Sokka says: "Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have."
Aang says: "Yeah, dumb stuff like that ...  Well, I've got to find a bathroom."
Wu says: "Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer?"
Katara says: "Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want.  So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?"
Wu says: "I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry."
Katara says: "Tell me more!"
Wu says: "I can see that he's a very powerful bender."
Sokka says: "Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break."
Aang says: "Yeah ... when I was in there ..."
Sokka says: "I don't even want to know!"
Wu says: "Who's next?"
Sokka says: "Okay, let's get this over with."
Wu says: "Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted."
Sokka says: "But you didn't read my palms or anything!"
Wu says: "I don't need to. It's written all over your face.  You there, come with me."
Wu says: "This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie.  Go on, pick one.  Now throw it on the fire.  The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny."
