Zuko says: "Nice work."
Katara says: "Aang, this is all my fault."
Aang says: "No Katara, it isn't."
Iroh says: "Yeah, it kind of is."
Zuko says: "Give me the boy."
Pirate captain says: "You give us the scroll."
Sokka says: "You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment?"
Zuko says: "Don't listen to him, he's trying to turn us against each other!"
Pirate captain says: "Your friend is the Avatar?"
Sokka says: "Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll."
Zuko says: "Shut your mouth, you Water Tribe peasant!"
Aang says: "Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth."
Sokka says: "I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life."
Pirate captain says: "Keep the scroll; we can buy a hundred with the reward we'll get for the kid."
Zuko says: "You'll regret breaking a deal with me."
Katara says: "Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples."
Sokka says: "Aang, are you there?"
Aang says: "I'm over here! Follow my voice!"
Sokka says: "Where? I can't find you!"
Aang says: "I'm right here!  Never mind! I'll find you!  Run!  Katara, you're okay!"
Katara says: "Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here."
Sokka says: "We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship."
Aang says: "A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders."
