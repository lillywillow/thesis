Zhao says: "... And by the year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule.  The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war."
Zuko says: "If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool!"
Zhao says: "Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue. So, how is your search for the Avatar going?"
Iroh says: "Eh.. My fault, entirely."
Zuko says: "We haven't found him yet."
Zhao says: "Did you really expect to? The Avatar died a hundred years ago.  Along with the rest of the airbenders.  Unless you have found some evidence that the Avatar is alive?"
Zuko says: "No.  Nothing."
Zhao says: "Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.  If you have an ounce of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you found."
Zuko says: "I haven't found  anything.  It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago.  Come on, Uncle, we're going."
Soldier says: "Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody,  but let him escape."
Zhao says: "Now remind me,  how, exactly, was your ship damaged?"
