Azula says: "All right hair, it's time to face your doom."
Ursa says: "What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair."
Azula says: "What are you doing hereâ€Œ?"
Ursa says: "I didn't want to miss my own daughter's coronation."
Azula says: "Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster."
Ursa says: "I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people, like your friends Mai and Ty Lee."
Azula says: "Well what choice do I have?!  Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me."
Ursa says: "No. I love you, Azula. I do."
