Toph says: "Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying."
The Duke says: "Helmet?"
Sokka says: "Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work."
Mechanist says: "Now don't sell yourself short, my boy.  It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant!  Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix.  The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface."
