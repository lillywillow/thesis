Iroh says: "Again."
Iroh says: "No!  Power in firebending comes from the breath , not the muscles.  The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire!  Get it right this time."
Zuko says: "Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm more than ready!"
Iroh says: "No, you are impatient.  You have yet to master your basics.  Drill it again!"
Zuko says: "The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.  He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.  You will teach me the advanced set!"
Iroh says: "Very well,  but first, I must finish my roast duck."
