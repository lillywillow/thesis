Zuko says: "How did you know I was here?"
Mai says: "Because I know you so well."
Zuko says: "But, how-"
Mai says: "The warden's my uncle, you idiot.  The truth is, I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart."
Zuko says: "I didn't mean to -"
Mai says: "You didn't mean to?  "Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.""
Zuko says: "Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation!"
Mai says: "Thanks Zuko, that makes me feel all better."
Zuko says: "Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country."
Mai says: "Save it? You're betraying your country!"
Zuko says: "That's not how I see it."
