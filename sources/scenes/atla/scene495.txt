Aang says: "Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka."
Sokka says: "Hi, Aang. Thanks for coming."
Aang says: "Looking for me?"
Zuko says: "You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?"
Katara says: "Aang?"
Sokka says: "No way!"
Zuko says: "I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training, meditating.  You're just a child!"
Aang says: "Well, you're just a teenager."
Aang says: "If I go with you,  will you promise to leave everyone alone?"
Katara says: "No! Aang, don't do this!"
Aang says: "Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay.  Take care of Appa for me until I get back."
Zuko says: "Head a course for the Fire Nation. I'm going home."
