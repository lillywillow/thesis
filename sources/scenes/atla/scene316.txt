Aang says: "Momo, marbles please.  Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!"
Katara says: "That's great, Aang."
Aang says: "You didn't even look."
Katara says: "That's great!"
Aang says: "But I'm not doing it now."
Sokka says: "Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing."
Katara says: "What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?"
Sokka says: "Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.  It's just the natural order of things."
Katara says: "All done with your pants!  And look what a great job I did!"
Sokka says: "Wait! I was just kidding.  I can't wear these! Katara, please!"
Aang says: "Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants."
Sokka says: "We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?"
Katara says: "He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring."
Aang says: "But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?"
Aang says: "I said, aren't you boy?"
Sokka says: "Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster."
Aang says: "Look!"
