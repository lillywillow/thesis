Katara says: "Wow, these flowers are beautiful."
Hama says: "They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water."
Katara says: "I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside."
Hama says: "You can take it even further."
Katara says: "That was incredible!  It's a shame about the lilies, though."
Hama says: "They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak."
Katara says: "But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon."
Hama says: "Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon?  I don't think we have anything to worry about."
