Sokka says: "Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't."
Katara says: "I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated."
Aang says: "Hey guys!  I want you to meet somebody!"
Sokka says: "Who's that?"
Aang says: "Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world.  He taught me everything I know."
