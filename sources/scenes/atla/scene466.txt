Katara says: "Aang?"
Aang says: "Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?  Heh heh. I have a way with animals."
Katara says: "Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending."
Aang says: "You got a deal! Just one little problem ...  I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?"
Katara says: "No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole."
Aang says: "This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.  What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you."
Katara says: "Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly "turn right at the second glacier". It's on the other side of the world."
Aang says: "But you forget, I have a flying bison.  Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master!"
Katara says: "That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before."
Aang says: "Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins?"
Katara says: "Okay, listen closely my young pupil.  Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.  Observe!"
Aang says: "Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha!"
