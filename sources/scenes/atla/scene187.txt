Suki says: "Well, we made it out. Now what?"
Sokka says: "Zuko, what are you doing?"
Zuko says: "My sister was on that island."
Sokka says: "Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop!"
Zuko says: "What I mean is she must have come here somehow.  There!  That's our way out of here!"
Azula says: "Leave us alone.  I never expected this from you.  The thing I don't understand is "Why?". Why would you do it? You know the consequences."
Mai says: "I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you."
Azula says: "No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!"
Ty Lee says: "Come on! Let's get out of here!"
Azula says: "You're both fools!"
Gondola guard #4 says: "What shall we do with them, princess?"
Azula says: "Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot!"
Katara says: "What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?"
Zuko says: "It kind of got destroyed."
Aang says: "Sounds like a crazy fishing trip."
Toph says: "Did you at least get some good meat?"
Sokka says: "I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood."
Chit Sang says: "I'm new. What's up, everybody?"
Katara says: "Dad?"
Hakoda says: "Hi, Katara."
Katara says: "How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go?"
Sokka says: "We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison."
