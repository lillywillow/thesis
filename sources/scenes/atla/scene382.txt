Zuko says: "Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother."
Katara says: "Go jump in the river!"
Zuko says: "Try to understand. I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor.  Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost."
Katara says: "My mother's necklace! How did you get that?"
Zuko says: "I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is."
Katara says: "No!"
Pirate captain says: "Enough of this necklace garbage! You promised a scroll!"
Zuko says: "I wonder how much this is worth ...  A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back, and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here!"
Pirate captain says: "Fine."
