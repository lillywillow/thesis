Katara says: "Are you okay?"
Zuko says: "No, I'm not okay. My uncle hates me, I know it.  He loved and supported me in every way he could, and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?"
Katara says: "Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?"
Zuko says: "More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life."
Katara says: "Then he'll forgive you. He will."
Zuko says: "Uncle?"
Aang says: "All these past Avatars.  They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it.  You're right. Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar will understand where I'm coming from.  I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.  I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that."
Yangchen says: "I am Avatar Yangchen, young airbender."
Aang says: "Avatar Yangchen,  the monks always taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web."
Yangchen says: "Yes. All life is sacred."
Aang says: "I know, I'm even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever. And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense. And I've certainly never used it to take a life."
Yangchen says: "Avatar Aang, I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well, but this isn't about you.  This is about the world."
Aang says: "But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free."
Yangchen says: "Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment,  but the Avatar can never do it. Because your sole duty is to the world. Here is my wisdom for you:  Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world."
Aang says: "I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.  I have to kill the Fire Lord."
