Aang says: "It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse."
Sokka says: "No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation."
Toph says: "If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for,  I'm just the girl to find it."
Sokka says: "The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord."
Aang says: "We can still do this. We can still win the day."
Katara says: "Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap.  Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely."
Hakoda says: "Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it."
Sokka says: "What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you."
Aang says: "I've gotta try."
