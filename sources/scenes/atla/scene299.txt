Shinu says: "Absolutely not! The Yuyan Archers stay here. Your request is denied, Commander Zhao."
Zhao says: "Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it.  You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards."
Shinu says: "I can do whatever I want with their talents, they're my archers, and what I say goes."
Zhao says: "But my search for the Avatar is-"
Shinu says: "Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a real war here, and I need every man I've got, commander."
Zhao says: "But-!"
Shinu says: "That's final! I don't wanna hear another word about it!"
Zhao says: "News from Fire Lord Ozai?"
Zhao says: "It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request ... is now an order."
