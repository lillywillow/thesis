Katara says: "Aang, you're awake!"
Aang says: "Are you sure?  I feel like I'm dreaming."

Sokka says: "Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy!"
Aang says: "Sokka?"
Toph says: "Uh-oh, somebody catch him, he's going to-"
Mai says: "Aren't you cold?"
Zuko says: "I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long, over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed."
Mai says: "I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story.  Stop worrying."
Aang says: "Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it?"
Katara says: "You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad.  I like your hair."
Aang says: "I have hair?  How long was I out?"
Katara says: "A few weeks."
Hakoda says: "Everything okay?"
Katara says: "We're fine, Dad."

Hakoda says: "I guess you're right."
Aang says: "Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda."
Hakoda says: "It's an honor to meet you."
Katara says: "Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy?"
Hakoda says: "Of course."
Aang says: "Are you mad at your dad or something?"
Katara says: "What, not at all. Why would you say that?"
Katara says: "Maybe we should go upstairs.  You need a healing session."
Katara says: "Tell me where the pain feels most intense."
Aang says: "Mmm, a little higher. Uhhh!"
Aang says: "Wow, you're definitely in the right area there."
Katara says: "I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there.  Let me just see if I can-"
