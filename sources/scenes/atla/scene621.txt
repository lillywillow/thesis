Toph says: "Dad, I know it's probably hard for you to see me this way. But the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me, but I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So, now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me."
Lao says: "Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something."
Toph says: "It has?"
Lao says: "Yes. I've let you had far too much freedom. From now on you'll be cared for and guarded twenty-four hours a day."
Toph says: "But, Dad!"
Poppy says: "We're doing this for your own good, Toph."
Lao says: "Please escort the Avatar and his friends out. They are no longer welcome here."
Aang says: "I'm sorry, Toph."
Toph says: "I'm sorry too. Goodbye, Aang."
Katara says: "Don't worry, we'll find you a teacher. There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there."
Aang says: "Not like her."
Aang says: "Toph! What are you doing here?"
Toph says: "My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world."
Sokka says: "Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again."
Toph says: "Good idea."
Aang says: "You're going to be a great teacher, Toph."
Toph says: "Speaking of which, I want to show you something."
Aang says: "Okay."
Toph says: "Now we're even. Um, I'll take the belt back."
Toph says: "Ow!"
Sokka says: "Sorry."
Lao says: "I know you two are very different. But I believe you have a common interest.  The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter. I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home."
