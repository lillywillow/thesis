Mechanist says: "We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius!"
Sokka says: "Thank you. You're a genius!"
Mechanist says: "Thank you!"
Sokka says: "See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne,  but once it did, it just kept going.  You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?"
Katara says: "Ugh, if only we knew."
Sokka says: "A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon."
Katara says: "Huh, that's actually pretty smart."
Sokka says: "Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs:  smoke, slime, fire, and ..."
Mechanist says: "Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink!"
