Zhao says: "Don't bother."
Aang says: "Zhao, don't!"
Zhao says: "It's my destiny, to destroy the moon and the Water Tribe."
Aang says: "Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe.  It will hurt everyone, including you.  Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world."
Iroh says: "He is right Zhao."
Zhao says: "General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?"
Iroh says: "I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now!"
Yue says: "There's no hope now, it's over."
Aang says: "No, it's not over."
