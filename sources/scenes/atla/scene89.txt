Aang says: "We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave."
Sokka says: "I messed up, Aang."
Aang says: "What?"
Sokka says: "The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart."
Aang says: "Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that."
Sokka says: "My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should."
Aang says: "Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield."
Sokka says: "You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?"
Aang says: "Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again."
