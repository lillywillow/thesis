Katara says: "I got it! I know how we're going to see the Earth King!"
Toph says: "How are we supposed to do that?  "One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King!""
Katara says: "The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear."
Aang says: "You mean, platypus bear?"
Katara says: "No, it just says 'bear'."
Sokka says: "Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear."
Toph says: "Or his armadillo bear."
Aang says: "Gopher bear?"
Katara says: "Just ... bear."
Toph says: "This place ... is weird."
Katara says: "The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd!"
Toph says: "Won't work."
Katara says: "Why not?"
Toph says: "Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners!"
Katara says: "Excuse me? I've got no manners?! You're not exactly "lady fancy fingers!""
Toph says: "I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it.  You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late."
Sokka says: "Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us!"
Aang says: "Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners beâ€Œ?"
Aang says: "Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness."
Sokka says: "Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on."
Toph says: "Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys!"
