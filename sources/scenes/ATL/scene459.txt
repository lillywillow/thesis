Sokka says: "It's not getting away from me this time.  Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish."
Katara says: "Sokka, look!"
Sokka says: "Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away.  Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'."
Katara says: "But, Sokka! I caught one!"
Katara says: "Hey!"
Sokka says: "Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?"
Katara says: "It's not "magic", it's waterbending! And it's ..."
Sokka says: "Yeah, yeah, "an ancient art unique to our culture", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying  that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself."
Katara says: "You're calling me weird?Â I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water!"
Katara says: "Watch out! Go left! Go left!"
Katara says: "You call that left?"
Sokka says: "You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've  waterbended us out of the ice."
Katara says: "So it's my fault?"
Sokka says: "I knew I should've left you home!  Leave it to a girl to screw things up!"
