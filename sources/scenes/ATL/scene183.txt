Suki says: "Sokka, what's going on?"
Sokka says: "I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up.  I just talked to my dad."
Suki says: "That's great."
Sokka says: "Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola."
Suki says: "What?"
Sokka says: "My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola  and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines."
Suki says: "We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards."
Sokka says: "My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot."
Suki says: "Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive."
Sokka says: "Not if the warden is the captive.  I have to go.  I'll find you before we start the riot."
Male guard says: "Hey, you, the warden wants to see you!"
Sokka says: "Why?"
Male guard says: "I don't know, I didn't ask."
Sokka says: "Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow?"
Male guard says: "He wants to see you ... now."
