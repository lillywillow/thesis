Roku says: "What's on your mind?"
Sozin says: "I've been thinking hard about the state of the world lately."
Roku says: "Sozin, it is my wedding! Have a cookie, dance with someone, lighten up!"
Sozin says: "I know, I know, but just hear me out.  Right from the start, I was destined to be Fire Lord. And although we didn't always know it, you were destined to be the Avatar.  It's an amazing stroke of fate we know each other so well, isn't it? Together, we could do ... anything."
Roku says: "Yeah, we could."
Sozin says: "Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we're so fortunate in so many ways."
Roku says: "Where are you going with this?"
Sozin says: "I've been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world.  In our hands is the most successful empire in history.  It's time we expanded it."
Roku says: "No! The four nations are meant to be just that: four."
Sozin says: "Roku, you haven't even stopped to consider the possibilities."
Roku says: "There are no possibilities. This is the last I want to hear  about this."
Roku says: "That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned  that Sozin  had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning."
