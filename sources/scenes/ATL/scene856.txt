Katara says: "That wolf sounds so sad."
Sokka says: "It's probably wounded."
Bato says: "No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the Water Tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family,  and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds."
Katara says: "Sokka?"
Sokka says: "We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most."
Katara says: "You're right."
Bato says: "Your father will understand, and I know he's proud of you."
Sokka says: "Thanks, Bato."
Bato says: "I know where to go from here.  Take this in case you want to find us. I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point."
Aang says: "Looks like we're going alone, guys."
Mother Superior says: "Avatar, you must leave!"
Aang says: "Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone."
Mother Superior says: "A group of people came to the abbey looking for you."
Aang says: "Who?"
Mother Superior says: "A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster, and a young man with a scar."
Aang says: "Zuko."
Mother Superior says: "The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you."
Aang says: "A necklace?  Katara!"
