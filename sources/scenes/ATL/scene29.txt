Merchant woman says: "Ahhh, it's good. It's perfect, I'm telling you!"
Katara says: "I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing."
Merchant woman says: "Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?"
Aang says: "I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe."
Katara says: "I just realized we're out of money anyway."
Shopkeeper says: "Awww!"
Sokka says: "Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?"
Katara says: "You could get a job, smart guy."
Fisherman's wife says: "We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm."
Fisherman says: "You're crazy. It's a nice day:  No clouds, no winds, no nothing. So quit your nagging, woman."
Aang says: "Maybe we should find some shelter?"
Sokka says: "Are you kidding? Shelter from what?"
Fisherman's wife says: "My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one."
Fisherman says: "Well, it's your joints against my brain."
Fisherman's wife says: "Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'."
Fisherman says: "Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get!  How do you like that?"
Sokka says: "I'll go."
Fisherman says: "You're hired!"
Sokka says: "What? You said get a job ... and he's paying double."
Fisherman says: "Double? Who told you that nonsense?"
