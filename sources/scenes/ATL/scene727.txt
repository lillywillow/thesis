Sokka says: "Thank goodness we're in time!"
Kuei says: "In time for what?"
Ty Lee says: "Yeah. What are you in time for,  cutie?"
Sokka says: "Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki."
Ty Lee says: "Who?"
Toph says: "They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!"
Mai says: "Sorry to disappoint you."
Ty Lee says: "Oooh, it's like we're dancing together!"
Azula says: "This fight is over."
Azula says: "Get them all out of my sight."
Long Feng says: "Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess!  I said arrest her!  What is wrong with you?!"
Azula says: "It's because they haven't made up their minds.  They're waiting to see how this is going to end."
Long Feng says: "What are you talking about?"
Azula says: "I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne, and which one is going to be bowing down.  But I know, and you know.  Well?"
Long Feng says: "You've beaten me at my own game."
Azula says: "Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player."
