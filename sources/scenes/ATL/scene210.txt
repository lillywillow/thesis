Iroh says: "Where are you taking me?"
Earthbender captain says: "We're taking you to face justice."
Iroh says: "Right, but where, specifically?"
Earthbender captain says: "A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you."
Iroh says: "Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se."
Earthbender captain says: "It was greater than you were, apparently."
Iroh says: "I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired.  And I'm still tired."
Kay-fon says: "I'm sure they'll be back."
Katara says: "I know."
Kay-fon says: "You should get some rest."
Katara says: "Everything's going to be okay ..."
Kay-fon says: "Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him."
Aang says: "Katara? Katara, I lost him."
Kay-fon says: "The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon."
Aang says: "What? No, I'm right here!  I'm in the Spirit World!"
