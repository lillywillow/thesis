Zuko says: "Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail."
Iroh says: "You mean the Avatar?"
Zuko says: "Don't mention his name on these docks!  Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way!"
Zhao says: "Getting in the way of what,  Prince Zuko?"
Zuko says: "Captain Zhao."
Zhao says: "It's commander now. And  General Iroh. Great hero of our nation."
Iroh says: "Retired general."
Zhao says: "The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests anytime. What brings you to my harbor?"
Iroh says: "Our ship is being repaired."
Zhao says: "That's quite a bit of damage."
Zuko says: "Yes.  You wouldn't believe what happened.  Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened."
Iroh says: "Yes. I will do that.  It was incredible!  What? Did we crash or something?"
Zuko says: "Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship!"
Zhao says: "Really? You must regale me with all of the thrilling details.  Join me for a drink?"
Zuko says: "Sorry, but we have to go."
Iroh says: "Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.  We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite."
