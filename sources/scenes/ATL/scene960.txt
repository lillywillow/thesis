Wu says: "Oh my!  Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!"
Aang says: "Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?"
Wu says: "A girl? You want to know about love?"
Aang says: "Yes!"
Wu says: "I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything."
Wu says: "Well, look!  I must've missed something.  Right here.  It says "trust your heart and you will be with the one you love.""
Aang says: "Really?  Thank you, Aunt Wu!"
