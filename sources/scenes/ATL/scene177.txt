Warden says: "Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say.  Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you."
Hakoda says: "No."
Warden says: "Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes?  Then take a look!"
Warden says: "I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed.  But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye!"
Warden says: "See, isn't that better?  You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all-"
Bogyguard #2 says: "Are you okay, sir?"
Warden says: "I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!"
Sokka says: "Thank goodness you're okay."
Hakoda says: "If you take one step closer, you'll see just how "okay" I am."
Sokka says: "Dad, it's me."
Hakoda says: "Sokka,  my son.  You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut."
Sokka says: "Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier."
