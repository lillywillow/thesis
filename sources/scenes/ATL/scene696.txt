Katara says: "So where are we going next‌?  We're starting from here ..."
Aang says: "No, we're over on this island."
Toph says: "You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka."
Katara says: "Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him‌?"
Piandao says: "You've had a good first day of training."
Sokka says: "I have‌? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on!"
Piandao says: "You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword."
Sokka says: "Are you giving me one of yours‌?"
Piandao says: "No."
Piandao says: "Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword."
