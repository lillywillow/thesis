Sokka says: "A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time?"
Sokka says: "Ugh!"
Aang says: "That answer your question?"
Sokka says: "Eww!"
Katara says: "That wasn't as bad as I thought."
Sokka says: "Ahh! They won't let go! Help!"
Aang says: "Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus."
Guard one says: "Hey! What are you kids doing out past curfew?"
Katara says: "Sorry. We were just on our way home."
Guard one says: "Wait, what's the matter with him?"
Katara says: "Uh, he has pentapox, sir.  Umm, it's highly contagious."
Sokka says: "Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying."
Katara says: "And deadly."
Guard two says: "Hey, I think I heard of pentapox! Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?"
Guard one says: "We'd better go wash our hands, and burn our clothes."
Aang says: "Thank you, sewer friends."
