King Bumi says: "Aang, stop your blowing for a minute."
King Bumi says: "Now hold on just a  duahhh!!!"
Aang says: "It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?"
King Bumi says: "Aang, I need to talk to you!"
Aang says: "It's good to see you too!"
Mai says: "How are you gonna fight without your bending?"
Sokka says: "I seem to manage!"
Katara says: "There's Aang!"
Sokka says: "We can catch him!"
Aang says: "Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!"
Aang says: "You could earthbend? All along?"
King Bumi says: "Well, they didn't cover my face."
Aang says: "I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?"
King Bumi says: "Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy."
Aang says: "I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating."
King Bumi says: "... and neutral jing when you do nothing!"
Aang says: "There areÂ three jings?"
King Bumi says: "Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike."
Aang says: "That's why you surrendered, isn't it?"
King Bumi says: "Yes, and it's why I can't leave now."
Aang says: "I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending."
King Bumi says: "Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking."
Aang says: "Hey, Momo!"
King Bumi says: "Momo's mastered a few jings himself!"
King Bumi says: "Goodbye, Aang. I'll see you when the time is right."
Mai says: "So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?"
Ty Lee says: "It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again,  won't it, Mai?"
Azula says: "It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore.  We have a third target now."
