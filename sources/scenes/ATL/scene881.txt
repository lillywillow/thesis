Katara says: "I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago."
Zuko says: "Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some reason."
Katara says: "Maybe you're not as good as you think you are."
Toph says: "Ouch."
Zuko says: "I bet it's because I changed sides."
Katara says: "That's ridiculous."
Aang says: "I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to."
Sokka says: "Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough."
Zuko says: "Okay, cut it out!  Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way."
Toph says: "You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend the original source."
Sokka says: "How's he supposed to do that‌? By jumping into a volcano‌?"
Toph says: "No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is."
Sokka says: "So, is it jumping into a volcano?"
Toph says: "I don't know.  For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles."
