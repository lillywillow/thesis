Mai says: "Orange is such an awful color."
Zuko says: "You're so beautiful when you hate the world."
Mai says: "I don't hate you."
Zuko says: "I don't hate you too."
Azula says: "Ahem.  Zuko, could I have a word with you?"
Zuko says: "Can't you see we're busy?"
Azula says: "Oh Mai, Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid."
Mai says: "Sounds pretty serious."
Azula says: "So, I've heard you've been to visit your uncle fatso in the prison tower."
Zuko says: "That guard told you."
Azula says: "No. You did. Just now."
Zuko says: "Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?"
Azula says: "Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum."
