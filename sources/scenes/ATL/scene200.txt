Ozai says: "And how was it Great-Grandfather Sozin managed to win the Battle of Han Tui?"
Young Zuko says: "Great-Grandfather won ... because ..."
Young Azula says: "Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes."
Ozai says: "Correct, my dear. Now, would you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?"
Ozai says: "She's a true prodigy! Just like her grandfather for whom she's named."
Young Azula says: "You'll never catch up ..."
Young Zuko says: "I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning."
Young Zuko says: "I failed."
Ursa says: "No. I loved watching you. That's who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard."
Azulon says: "Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want. Everyone else, go!"
Young Zuko says: "What are you -?"
Young Azula says: "Shh!"
Ozai says: "Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home. But I am here, Father, and my children are alive."
Azulon says: "Say what it is you want!"
Ozai says: "Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me."
Azulon says: "You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born? Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough! But you ... your punishment has scarcely begun!"
