Katara says: "Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you."
Wu says: "Any time."
Katara says: "About this man I'm supposed to marry ...  Is he going to be handsome?  Oh, I hope he's tall!"
Wu says: "Ah ... You want another reading?"
Katara says: "Yes, please!"
Sokka says: "I can't believe all these saps!  Someone really needs to scream some sense into them."
Aang says: "They seem happy, Sokka."
Sokka says: "Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.  Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?"
Man says: "Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love."
Sokka says: "Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?"
Man says: "Everyday."
Sokka says: "Then of course it's gonna come true!"
Man says: "Really? You think so?  I'm so excited!"
