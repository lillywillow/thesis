Pakku says: "Nice try, Pupil Sangok.  A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge.  Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?  Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained.  You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything.  Raw talent alone is not enough.  Pupil Aang!"
Aang says: "Yes, Master Pakku?"
Pakku says: "Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending."
Aang says: "I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out."
