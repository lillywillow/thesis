Bato says: "There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father."
Katara says: "Really?"
Sokka says: "When?"
Bato says: "Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message when they found the rendezvous point. If you wait until the message arrives, you can come with me, and see your father again."
Sokka says: "It's been over two years since we've seen Dad. That would be so incredible! Katara!"
Katara says: "I do really miss him, it would be great to see Dad."
Bato says: "It's been far too long, hasn't it?  I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does-"
Sokka says: "It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first."
Katara says: "Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour."
Bato says: "I'm sure your father would understand, and be proud that his children are helping the Avatar."
