Earth King says: "I don't care how you do it, but I want you to squash those unruly peasants!"
Kyoshi says: "I won't do it."
Earth King says: "How dare you defy your King!  Guards, arrest Avatar Kyoshi!"
Kyoshi says: "How dare you defy your Avatar! Are you ready to make a compromise?"
Earth King says: "Yes ..."
Kyoshi says: "I don't like this revolution either. But everyone in this Kingdom must have a voice if balance is to prevail over tyranny. So I propose this - you will listen to the peasants' grievances and I will protect you interests and Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage. Agreed?"
Earth King says: "Agreed ..."
