Katara says: "I have a surprise for everyone!"
Toph says: "I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru!"
Katara says: "Uh, no.  I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this!  Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute?"
Katara says: "Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing."
Zuko says: "That's not me. It's my father."
Suki says: "But he looks so sweet and innocent."
Zuko says: "Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers."
Aang says: "But he's still a human being."
Zuko says: "You're going to defend him?"
Aang says: "No, I agree with you.  Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way."
Zuko says: "Like what?"
Aang says: "I don't know.  Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore."
Zuko says: "Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again."
Aang says: "Do you really think that would work?"
Zuko says: "No!"
Aang says: "This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like."
Sokka says: "Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you."
Aang says: "This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in."
Katara says: "Aang, we do understand. It's just ..."
Aang says: "Just what, Katara? What?"
Katara says: "We're trying to help!"
Aang says: "Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it!"
Katara says: "Aang, don't walk away from this."
Zuko says: "Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself."
Aang says: "Hey, Momo. I don't suppose you know what I should do.  I didn't think so."
