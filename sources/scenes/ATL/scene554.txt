Iroh says: "Basics, Zuko!  Break his root!"
Zhao says: "Do it!"
Zhao says: "That's it? Your father raised a coward."
Zuko says: "Next time you get in my way, I promise, I won't hold back."
Iroh says: "No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory.  So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat?  Disgraceful.  Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.  Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious."
Zuko says: "Did you really mean that, Uncle?"
Iroh says: "Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite."
Katara says: "Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.  Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone,  but you still have a family. Sokka and I!  We're your family now!"
Sokka says: "Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise."
Aang says: "I'm sorry."
Katara says: "It's okay. It wasn't your fault."
Aang says: "But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too.  I really am the last airbender."
Katara says: "Everything's packed. You ready to go?"
Aang says: "How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?"
Katara says: "Maybe you'll find a way."
Aang says: "Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!"
Sokka says: "Can't talk! Must eat!"
Aang says: "Hey, little guy!"
