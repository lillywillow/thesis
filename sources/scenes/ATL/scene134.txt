Roku says: "I've seen the colonies, Sozin.  How dare you occupy Earth Kingdom territory!"
Sozin says: "How dare you, a citizen of the Fire Nation, address your Fire Lord this way.  Your loyalty is to our nation first. Anything less makes you a traitor."
Roku says: "Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over."
Roku says: "I'm sparing you, Sozin.  I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you.  Even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end."
