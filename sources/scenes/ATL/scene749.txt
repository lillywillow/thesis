Katara says: "Hey. How long have you been up?"
Aang says: "A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai."
Katara says: "You know, there is such a thing as over-training."
Aang says: "You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics."
Sokka says: "That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it.  Plus, it's a stupid element."
Aang says: "Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training."
Aang says: "Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-"
Toph says: "Go to sleep already!"
