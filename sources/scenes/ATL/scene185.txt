Bully guard says: "I am not!  He's lying!  He's a liar!"
Bully guard says: "I'm telling you ... it wasn't me!"
Warden says: "Save your breath! I know you were working together.  You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan."
Bully guard says: "That was just a coincidence!"
Bodyguard #2 says: "Sir, there's someone to see you."
Warden says: "Who told you to interrupt me?"
Azula says: "I did."
Warden says: "Princess Azula.  Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison.  I didn't realize you were coming."
Azula says: "Who is this?"
Warden says: "He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt."
Bully guard says: "It wasn't me!"
Warden says: "Quiet, you!"
Azula says: "You're wasting your time. That's not one of them."
Warden says: "How do you know?"
Azula says: "Because I'm a people person."
Sokka says: "Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard."
Door guard says: "But we're in the middle of a lockdown."
Sokka says: "Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that.  I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again?"
Door guard says: "Wait! Don't tell the warden. I'm just a little confused."
Sokka says: "Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says."
Door guard says: "Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out!"
Sokka says: "This is it! We have to start a riot."
Suki says: "Okay. But how do we do that?"
Hakoda says: "I'll show you."
Tough prisoner says: "Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings."
Hakoda says: "Aren't you mad at me?"
Tough prisoner says: "Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger."
Sokka says: "This isn't working."
Chit Sang says: "Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out,  but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in."
Sokka says: "Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot.  You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you?"
Chit Sang says: "A prison riot? Please.  Hey!  Riot!"
Hakoda says: "Impressive."
Tough prisoner says: "Forget about controlling my anger ...  let's riot!"
Warden says: "Who let these prisoners into the yard?  This is supposed to be a lockdown!"
Male guard #2 says: "Ma'am, there's a riot going on! I'm here to protect you!"
Mai says: "I don't need any protection."
Zuko says: "Believe me, she doesn't."
Male guard #2 says: "I'm sorry, but I'm under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens."
Mai says: "Get off of me!"
Sokka says: "Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas!"
Zuko says: "And how do we do that?"
Sokka says: "I'm not sure."
Zuko says: "I thought you thought this through!"
Sokka says: "I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!"
Zuko says: "Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important!"
Chit Sang says: "Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it."
Warden says: "You wouldn't dare."
Suki says: "Sorry, warden. You're my prisoner now.  We've got the warden! Now let's get out of here!"
Hakoda says: "That's some girl."
Sokka says: "Tell me about it."
