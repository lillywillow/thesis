Tong says: "From now on, we'll celebrate a new Avatar Day in honor of the day Avatar Aang  saved us from the Rough Rhino Invasion."
Sokka says: "What is this?"
Tong says: "That's our new festival food! Un-fried dough. May we eat it and be reminded of how on this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil."
Katara says: "Happy Avatar Day, everyone!"
Sokka says: "This is by far the worst town we've ever been to."

Sokka says: "This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force."
Toph says: "How did you pick this place?"
Sokka says: "Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place."
Katara says: "Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule."
Aang says: "Wait! Four days? The invasion's in four days?"
Sokka says: "Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and-"
Katara says: "Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest."
Aang says: "I guess."
