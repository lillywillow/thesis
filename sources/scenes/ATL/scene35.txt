Aang says: "How do you know it's me?"
Tashi says: "We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?"
Aang says: "Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!"
Tashi says: "You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives."
Aang says: "I just chose them because they seemed fun."
