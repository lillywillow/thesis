Sokka says: "Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax."
Katara says: "You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life."
Sokka says: "That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful!"
Sokka says: "That doesn't prove anything!"
Katara says: "Well, I liked my predictions.  Certain things are going to turn out very well."
Aang says: "They sure are ..."
Katara says: "Why? What did she tell you?"
Aang says: "Some stuff. You'll find out."
Katara says: "What's with the sky?"
Calm man says: "We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village."
Aang says: "That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny."
Calm man says: "You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction."
Sokka says: "Do you even hear yourself?"
Village Woman says: "The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt."
Calm man says: "We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves.  But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of not doing that."
Sokka says: "I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition!"
Katara says: "Shhh! She's coming!"
