Captain says: "We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm, but if we continue heading northeast ..."
Zuko says: "What do they want?"
Iroh says: "Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho!"
Soldier says: "The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao."
Iroh says: "Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!"
Zuko says: "I've got nothing to report to Admiral Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass."
Soldier says: "Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area."
Zuko says: "Off my ship!"
Iroh says: "Excellent! I take the pot!  But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again."
