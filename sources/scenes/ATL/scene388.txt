Pakku says: "Katara, I want you to have this.  This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. The water has unique properties. Don't lose it."
Katara says: "Thank you, Master Pakku."
Pakku says: "Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending. But remember, they're no substitute for a real master.  Sokka ...  take care, son.  Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here. General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There, you will be safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi."
Aang says: "Appa, yip yip!"
Katara says: "Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!"
