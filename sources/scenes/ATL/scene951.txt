Katara says: "Look!"
Sokka says: "He is taunting us!  You are so going to be dinner!"
Sokka says: "Hey, where's the fishing line?"
Aang says: "Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka."
Sokka says: "Aw, it's all tangled!"
Aang says: "Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ..."
Katara says: "Thanks, Aang.  I love it."
Sokka says: "Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business."
Aang says: "I don't see why I can't do both."
Sokka says: "Stop taunting me!"
Katara says: "So, how do I look?"
