Azula says: "Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on."
Azula says: "Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now."
Sokka says: "I fell for it! I used up all our time."
Toph says: "It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out."
Sokka says: "And now it's too late."
Aang says: "Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway."
Sokka says: "No. I don't think that's a good idea."
Aang says: "But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me."
Toph says: "The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends."
Aang says: "I guess you guys are right."
Sokka says: "You'll have another chance. I know you will."
