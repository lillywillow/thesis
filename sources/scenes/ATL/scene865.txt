Kyoshi Warrior #1 says: "Must have been some fight."
Suki says: "Wait, let me see that.  No, it couldn't be.  Appa? Oh, no.  It's gonna be okay, Appa.  I have to leave, but I'm gonna be back soon with help."
Suki says: "No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt.  He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet."
Kyoshi Warrior #1 says: "I can't believe you found the Avatar's bison. Didn't you just see the Avatar a few days ago?"
Suki says: "Yes, so he can't be too far from here.  It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet.  Give him some space!  Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend.  I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better.  And we can help you find Aang."
