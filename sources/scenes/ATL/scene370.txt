Zuko says: "What is the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!"
Iroh says: "Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko."
Zuko says: "Is it something to do with the Avatar?"
Iroh says: "Even more urgent. It seems, I-  -I have lost my lotus tile."
Zuko says: "Lotus tile?"
Iroh says: "For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ."
Zuko says: "You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?"
Iroh says: "See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.  Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life.  I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew."
