Zhao says: "It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him!  Let's find out what my old master has taught you."
Aang says: "You were Jeong Jeong's student?!"
Zhao says: "Until I got bored."
Zhao says: "I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!"
Aang says: "Whoa! Wild shot!"
Zhao says: "I'll show you wild!"
Aang says: "No self-control ..."
Zhao says: "Stand and fight, Avatar!"
Aang says: "Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up!"
Zhao says: "I was ..."
Aang says: "Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!   Ahoy!  I'm Admiral Zhao!  I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.  Sloppy. Very sloppy."
Zhao says: "Nowhere to run now, you little smart mouth!"
Aang says: "You've lost this battle."
Zhao says: "Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!"
Aang says: "No, but you have.  Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.  Have a nice walk home!"
Sokka says: "Aang, come on! Let's go!"
Aang says: "Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?"
Sokka says: "He disappeared. They all did."
Chey says: "Hey, where did everybody go?  Very funny guys"
Katara says: "Aang, you're burned! Let me help you."
Aang says: "Wow, that's good water."
Sokka says: "When did you learn that?"
Katara says: "I guess I always knew."
Sokka says: "Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble.  Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!"
Aang says: "Two?"
Katara says: "He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook."
Sokka says: "Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful."
