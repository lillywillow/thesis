Aang says: "I guess."
Sokka says: "Don't be modest!  They're huge!"

Sokka says: "I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense."
Katara says: "Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?"
