Ozai says: "I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because you and your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment: you slayed the Avatar."
Zuko says: "What did you hear?"
Ozai says: "Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth."
