Iroh says: "Zuko,  remember that plant I thought might be tea?"
Zuko says: "You didn't ..."
Iroh says: "I did ...  and it wasn't."
Zuko says: "Ahh!"
Iroh says: "When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.  But look what I found.  These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade.  That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness."
Zuko says: "We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help."
Iroh says: "But where are we going to go?  We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation."
Zuko says: "If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed."
Iroh says: "But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula."
Zuko says: "Earth Kingdom it is."
