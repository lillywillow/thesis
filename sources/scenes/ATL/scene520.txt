Pakku says: "I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her."
Katara says: "But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage."
Aang says: "Go get her."
Yue says: "What do you want from me?"
Sokka says: "Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me."
Yue says: "You don't understand."
Sokka says: "No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant."
Yue says: "No, Sokka ..."
Sokka says: "It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay?  Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused."
Yue says: "I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged.  I'm sorry."
Pakku says: "Not bad, not bad.  Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age."
Aang says: "Hey, Katara!"
Pakku says: "What do you think you're doing?  It's past sunrise. You're late."
Aang says: "Good to see you here."
Katara says: "You, too."
Zhao says: "My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe."
