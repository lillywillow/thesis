Young Azula says: "Dad's going to kill you!  Really, he is."
Young Zuko says: "Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try."
Young Azula says: "Fine, don't believe me. But I heard everything. Grandfather said Dad's punishment should fit his crime.  "You must know the pain of losing a first-born son. By sacrificing your own!""
Young Zuko says: "Liar!"
Young Azula says: "I'm only telling you for your own good. I know! Maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you!"
Young Zuko says: "Stop it! You're lying! Dad would never do that to me!"
Ursa says: "Your father would never do what to you? What is going on here?"
Young Azula says: "I don't know ..."
Ursa says: "It's time for a talk!"
Young Zuko says: "Azula always lies. Azula always lies."
