Toph says: "Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?"
Aang says: "Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.  And here's one that I made out of noodles!"
Sokka says: "Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous."
Aang says: "I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow."
Sokka says: "Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days."
Aang says: "Flamey-O, hotman!"
Sokka says: "Flamey-O?"
Zuko says: "You brought this on yourself you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero!  You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.  You're not going to say anything?  You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!"
