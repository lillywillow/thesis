Zuko says: "After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness.  He's the one who's been a real father to me."
Ozai says: "Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure."
Zuko says: "But I've come to an even more important decision.  I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you."
Ozai says: "Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now?"
Zuko says: "Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.  Goodbye."
Ozai says: "Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother?"
Zuko says: "What happened that night?"
Ozai says: "My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it.  Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost.  She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared."
