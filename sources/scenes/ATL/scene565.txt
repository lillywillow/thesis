Ozai says: "I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lowly prison cell."
Zuko says: "You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life."
Ozai says: "Hmph."
Zuko says: "Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you."
Ozai says: "Why are you really here?"
Zuko says: "Because you're going to tell me something.  Where is my mother?"
Sokka says: "Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together."
Katara says: "That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka.  Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?"
Sokka says: "Those are your hair loopies!"
Zuko says: "At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine! My hair is not that spiky!"
Mai says: "I look like a man."
Suki says: "And why did you paint me firebending?"
Sokka says: "I thought it looked more exciting that way.  Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?"
Iroh says: "Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down."
Toph says: "Well I think you all look perfect!"

Katara says: "Look, the Inner Wall!  I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece."
Sokka says: "Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!"
Toph says: "You been hitting the cactus juice again?"
Sokka says: "I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us."
