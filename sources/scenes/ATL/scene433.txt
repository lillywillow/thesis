Katara says: "It's those three girls from Omashu!"
Toph says: "We can take them. Three on three."
Sokka says: "Actually Toph, there's four of us."
Toph says: "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all."
Sokka says: "I can still fight!"
Toph says: "Okay, three on three plus Sokka."
Sokka says: "Errrgh!"
Sokka says: "Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out.  Now let's get out of here."
Aang says: "Appa, yip yip!"
Katara says: "I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu."
Toph says: "I still think we could have taken them."
Katara says: "Are you kidding me?  The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary."
