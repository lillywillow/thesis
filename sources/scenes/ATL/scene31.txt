Aang says: "Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky."
Sokka says: "I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather."
Fisherman's wife says: "The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!"
Fisherman says: "Boy with tattoos?  Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya?"
Katara says: "That's right."
Fisherman says: "Well, don't be so smiley about it.  The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world!"
Katara says: "Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone."
Fisherman says: "Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering."
Katara says: "Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.  It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang?  Aang, what's wrong?"
Fisherman says: "That's right! Keep flying!"
Katara says: "You're a horrible old man!  Appa, yip yip!"
Sokka says: "Hey! They left without saying good-bye!"
Fisherman says: "Your friends ain't too polite, are they?"
Sokka says: "I know! This one time, I was ..."
Fisherman says: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck!"
