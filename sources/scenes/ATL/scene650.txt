Sokka says: "Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there."
Zuko says: "Just trust me."
Azula says: "Come on slowpokes! Faster!"
Azula says: "Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?"
Ozai says: "There has been a change of plans, Azula."
Azula says: "What?"
Ozai says: "I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation."
Azula says: "But I thought we were going to do this together."
Ozai says: "My decision is final."
Azula says: "You ... you can't treat me like this!  You can't treat me like Zuko!"
Ozai says: "Azula, silence yourself."
Azula says: "But it was my idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!"
Ozai says: "Azula!  Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you."
Azula says: "Really?"
Ozai says: "And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord."
Azula says: "Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you?"
Ozai says: "Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world.  From this moment on, I will be known as ...  the Phoenix King."
Katara says: "And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?"
Zuko says: "June."
Sokka says: "Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole."
Suki says: "Mole? Her skin is flawless."
Sokka says: "No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on."
Zuko says: "The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him."
Toph says: "I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her."
