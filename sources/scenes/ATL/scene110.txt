Azula says: "It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side."
Zuko says: "Wait, I need to ask you something.  What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?"
Azula says: "Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works.  Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course.  He spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world.  In the end, he died a very old and successful man."
Zuko says: "But how did he die?"
Azula says: "Didn't you pay any attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep.  He was ancient."
