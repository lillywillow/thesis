Ozai says: "So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?"
Aang says: "Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!"
Aang says: "I've gotta be ready."
Katara says: "Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep."
Aang says: "But I forgot my pants and my math test."
Katara says: "Aang, sleep. Please. For me."
