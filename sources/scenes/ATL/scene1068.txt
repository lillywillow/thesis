Ozai says: "Why are you here?"
Zuko says: "I'm here to tell the truth."
Ozai says: "Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse.  This should be interesting."
Zuko says: "First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me."
Ozai says: "Why would she lie to me about that?"
Zuko says: "Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived."
Ozai says: "What?"
Zuko says: "In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now."
Ozai says: "Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you!"
Zuko says: "That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore."
Ozai says: "You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last!"
Zuko says: "Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen."
