Aang says: "When are they coming?"
Mechanist says: "Soon.  Very soon."
Aang says: "You can't give them more weapons."
Mechanist says: "If I don't give them what they want, they will destroy this place!"
Teo says: "How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?"
Mechanist says: "I need some time to think.  You need to leave! Go!"
Teo says: "We're not leaving!"
Mechanist says: "Then hide! Quickly!"
Qin says: "You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way.  Well? Is there a problem?"
Mechanist says: "No, right this way."
Aang says: "The deal's off."
Qin says: "The Avatar ..."
Mechanist says: "Aang, don't get involved!"
Qin says: "If I don't get what I came here for, the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!"
Aang says: "Get out of here!  You're leaving empty-handed!"
Qin says: "Then the destruction of this temple  will be on your head!"
Teo says: "This is bad."
Sokka says: "Very bad!"
Katara says: "Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away?"
Aang says: "I'll tell you how. We have something they don't.  Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!"
Mechanist says: "I want to help."
Aang says: "Good. We'll need it."
