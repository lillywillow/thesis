Katara says: "But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war."
Aang says: "And how am I going to do that?"
Katara says: "According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?"
Aang says: "That's what the monks told me."
Katara says: "Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!"
Aang says: "We can learn it together!"
Katara says: "And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way."
Sokka says: "I'd like that. I'd reeally like that."
Katara says: "Then we're in this together!"
Aang says: "All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to.  Here, here and here."
Katara says: "What's there?"
Aang says: "Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas.  Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.  Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys.  They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!"
Main Aang Appa Katara Sokka Antagonists Iroh Zuko says: "Minor Kanna Southern Water Tribe boy Southern Water Tribe girl"
Sokka says: "I'm not one to complain,  but can't Appa fly any higher?"
Aang says: "I have an idea! Why don't we all get on your  back and you could fly us to the North Pole?!"
Sokka says: "I'd love to.  Climb on everyone,  Sokka's ready for take off."
Katara says: "Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight."
Sokka says: "And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe.  There's nothing up here."
