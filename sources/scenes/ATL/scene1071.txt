Aang says: "I can't pin her down! She's too quick!"
Sokka says: "Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!"
Azula says: "Not true. I'm giving it my all."
Toph says: "You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!"
Azula says: "Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes."
Toph says: "I'll roll your whole head!"
Sokka says: "She's just baiting you again."
Aang says: "Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her?"
Sokka says: "We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow."
Azula says: "It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you."
Sokka says: "Ignore!"
Azula says: "So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.  She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you."
Azula says: "Come and get it."
Sokka says: "Where. Is. Suki?!"
