Sokka says: "You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ...  Gotcha!  You are one lucky little meat creature."
Iroh says: "Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind."
Zuko says: "I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind."
Iroh says: "Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes.  There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning."
Zuko says: "I'm ready to try it!"
Iroh says: "Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first."
Toph says: "This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this!"
Katara says: "Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?"
Toph says: "I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way.  This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara."
Aang says: "Yeah, thanks, Katara!"
Katara says: "Heh."
