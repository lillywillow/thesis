Ozai says: "Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head!  Rise and shine! You overslept.  You missed the invasion."
Aang says: "Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!"
Sokka says: "What? Who's talking?"
Toph says: "Relax! It's still two days before the invasion!"
Aang says: "Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises."
Sokka says: "What?"
Aang says: "In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff,  but you were too slow and they got you!"
Sokka says: "But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber!"
Aang says: "Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!"
