Zuko says: "Welcome back."
Aang says: "It's good to be back."
Zuko says: "That won't be enough to escape."
Aang says: "Appa!"
Zuko says: "Here for a rematch?"
Katara says: "Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match."
Sokka says: "Hey, this is some quality rope!"
Aang says: "We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble!"
Aang says: "Wait, we can't just leave him here."
Sokka says: "Sure we can. Let's go."
Aang says: "No, if we leave him he'll die."
Sokka says: "Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us."
Sokka says: "Are you okay?"
Yue says: "I feel faint."
Aang says: "I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble."
Yue says: "I owe the Moon Spirit my life."
Sokka says: "What do you mean?"
Yue says: "When I was born I was very sick and very weak.  Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed.  Our healers did everything they could.  They told my mother and father I was going to die.  My father pleaded with the spirits to save me.  That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond.  My dark hair turned white.  I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live.  That's why my mother named me Yue.  For the moon."
Zhao says: "I am ... a legend, now!  The Fire Nation will, for generations, tell stories about the great Zhao, who darkened the moon. They will call me, Zhao the Conqueror, Zhao the Moon Slayer, Zhao the Invincible!  Ugh ... Get it off! Get it off!"
