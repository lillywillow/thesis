Lieutenant Jee says: "Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all."
Iroh says: "Lucky guess."
Zuko says: "Lieutenant! You'd better learn some respect  â€“ or I will teach it to you."
Jee says: "What do you know about respect?  The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know nothing about respect!  You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?"
Iroh says: "Easy now.  Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better."
Zuko says: "I don't need your help keeping order on my ship."
