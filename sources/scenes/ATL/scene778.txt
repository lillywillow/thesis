Chan says: "All right, listen. My dad's an admiral. He has no idea I'm having this party,  so don't mess anything up."
Azula says: "That's a sharp outfit, Chan. Careful.  You could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea,  because it's so sharp."
Chan says: "Um ... thanks."
Ruon-Jian says: "Hey! First ones here, huh?"
Zuko says: "He thinks he's so great.  Well, what do you think of him?"
Mai says: "I don't have any opinion about him. I hardly know him."
Zuko says: "You like him, don't you?"
Ember Island teenager #2 says: "So how do you know Ty Lee?"
Ember Island teenager #3 says: "I met her at the beach today. She was pretty impressed by a sand pagoda that I made for her."
Ember Island teenager #1 says: "Well, I met her first."
Ty Lee says: "Look, i-it doesn't matter who I met first, 'cause I like you all."
Ember Island teenager #2 says: "But which one of us do you like?"
Ember Island teenager #1 says: "Yeah."
Ember Island teenager #3 says: "Tell us."
Ty Lee says: "I don't know! I don't know!  Oh, I'm glad you're here. Those boys won't leave me alone. I guess they all just like me too much."
Azula says: "Come on, Ty Lee. You can't be this ignorant."
Ty Lee says: "What are you talking about?"
Azula says: "Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.  Okay, okay, calm down. I didn't mean what I said.  Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little ...  jealous."
Ty Lee says: "What? You're jealous of me? But you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world."
Azula says: "Well, you're right about all those things.  But, for some reason, when I meet boys, they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them."
Ty Lee says: "But you probably would do something horrible to them. I'm sure they're just intimidated by you. Okay, look, if you want a boy to like you,  just look at him and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says even if it's not funny."
Azula says: "Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid ...  Let's try it."
Ty Lee says: "Okay.  Hey there, sweet sugar cakes. How you liking this party?"
Mai says: "I'm bored."
Zuko says: "I know."
Mai says: "I'm hungry."
Zuko says: "So what?"
Mai says: "So, find me some food."
Zuko says: "Sure."
