Azula says: "My, my, you're easy to find. It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet."
Suki says: "What do you want with us?"
Azula says: "Who are you? The Avatar's fan girls?"
Ty Lee says: "Oh, I get it. Good one, Azula."
Suki says: "If you're looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck."
Mai says: "I knew this was a waste of time."
Azula says: "No Avatar, huh. Well, that's okay. Any friend of the Avatar  is an enemy of mine!"
Kyoshi Warrior #2 says: "Huh?"
Mai says: "You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous."
Ty Lee says: "You're not prettier than we are."
