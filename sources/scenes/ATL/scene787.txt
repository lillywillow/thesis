Aang says: "I think I see a cave below."
Sokka says: "Sh! Keep quiet!"
Sokka says: "Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut."
Toph says: "Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in."
Sokka says: "Hey, we're in enemy territory.  Those are enemy birds."
Sokka says: "Well, this is it.  This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.  Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ..."
Katara says: "Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes."
Aang says: "Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out.  If we get Fire Nation disguises,  we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave."
Toph says: "Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers?"
Sokka says: "Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes."
