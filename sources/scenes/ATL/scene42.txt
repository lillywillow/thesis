Gyatso says: "Very interesting move, young one."
Aang says: "What do you mean?"
Aang says: "Hey!"
Tashi says: "You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training!"
Gyatso says: "Aang has already trained enough for today."
Tashi says: "Time is short.  Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques."
Gyatso says: "No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho."
Tashi says: "Hmph."
