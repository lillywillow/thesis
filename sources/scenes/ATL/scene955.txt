Sokka says: "Mmm, lunch!  Lucky for you, we came along."
Calm man says: "Thanks, but everything was already under control. Not to worry. Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey."
Aang says: "Aunt who?"
Calm man says: "No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future."
Katara says: "Wow, it must be.  That explains why you were so calm!"
Sokka says: "But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey; you were almost killed!"
Calm man says: "But I wasn't! All right, have a good one!  Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this."
Katara says: "Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun."
Sokka says: "Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!"
Aang says: "What do you know? An umbrella!"
Katara says: "That proves it!"
Sokka says: "No, it doesn't! You can't really tell the future!"
Katara says: "I guess you're not really getting wet then."
Sokka says: "Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day!"
Katara says: "Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella."
Sokka says: "Look, I'm going to predict the future now.  It's going to keep drizzling.  See?"
Aang says: "Not everyone has the gift, Sokka."
Sokka says: "Agh!"
