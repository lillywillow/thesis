Iroh says: "Here is your tea.  You seem a little too young to be traveling alone."
Toph says: "You seem a little too old."
Iroh says: "Perhaps I am."
Toph says: "I know what you're thinking ... I look like I can't handle being by myself."
Iroh says: "I wasn't thinking that."
Toph says: "You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea!"
Iroh says: "I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason."
Toph says: "People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself."
Iroh says: "You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you."
Toph says: "So where is your nephew?"
Iroh says: "I've been tracking him actually."
Toph says: "Is he lost?"
Iroh says: "Yes, a little bit.  His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away."
Toph says: "So now you're following him."
Iroh says: "I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there."
Toph says: "Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  Thank you."
Iroh says: "My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights."
Toph says: "No, thank you for what you said. It helped me."
Iroh says: "I'm glad."
Toph says: "Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too."
