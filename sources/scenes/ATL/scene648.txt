Sokka says: "Okay, that's everything."
Toph says: "No, it's not. Where's Aang?"
Zuko says: "Aang? Aang!"
Toph says: "Come on, lazy bones, let's go."
Sokka says: "He left his staff.  That's so strange."
Zuko says: "Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach."
Sokka says: "Look, there's his footprints.  The trail ends here."
Suki says: "So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back?"
Katara says: "Maybe he was captured."
Sokka says: "I don't think so.  There's no sign of a struggle."
Toph says: "I bet he ran away again."
Sokka says: "Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa."
Toph says: "Then what do you think happened to him, oh sleuthy one?"
Sokka says: "It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey."
Zuko says: "But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?"
Sokka says: "Oh, yeah. Forgot about that."
Katara says: "Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him."
Toph says: "I'm going with Zuko!  What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn."
Crowd says: "Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang!"
Actress Aang says: "Avatar State!  Yip-yip!"
