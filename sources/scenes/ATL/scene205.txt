Sokka says: "Listen.  It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere."
Katara says: "Aang? Are you okay?"
Sokka says: "Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for -"
Katara says: "Shhh!"
Sokka says: "What? I'm not allowed to be angry?"
Aang says: "Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?"
Katara says: "Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you."
Aang says: "Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job."
Katara says: "That's why we're going to the North Pole.  To find you a teacher."
Aang says: "Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me."
Sokka says: "The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him?"
Aang says: "I don't know."
Zuko says: "Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!"
Iroh says: "Over here!"
Zuko says: "Uncle? We need to move on. We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him."
Iroh says: "You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles?"
Zuko says: "My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!"
Iroh says: "You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself."
Zuko says: "Enough! We need to leave now. Get out of the water!"
Iroh says: "Very well!"
Zuko says: "On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes? But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you!"
