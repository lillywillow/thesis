Sokka says: "Okay, forget about setting up camp.  I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep."
Katara says: "That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway!"
Toph says: "Oh, I didn't realize the baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed."
Aang says: "Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what  or who it is."
Katara says: "It could be Zuko.  We haven't seem him since the North Pole."
Toph says: "Who's Zuko?"
Sokka says: "Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world."
Katara says: "What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?"
Sokka says: "This is a warrior's wolf tail."
Katara says: "Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky."
Sokka says: "Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?"
Sokka says: "No Momo, shhh.  Sleepy time."
Sokka says: "Oh, don't tell me ..."
Aang says: "That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us."
Toph says: "I can feel it with my own two feet!"
Katara says: "Let's get out of here."
Aang says: "Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly."
Sokka says: "Always the optimist ..."
