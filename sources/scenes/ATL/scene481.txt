Yue says: "Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather."
Katara says: "I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't."
Sokka says: "They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them."
Koh says: "It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.  So ... how may I help you?"
Aang says: "I need to find the moon and the ocean."
Koh says: "Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time."
Aang says: "Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help."
Koh says: "Oh, you think you need their help.  Actually it's quite the other way round.  Someone's going to kill them!"
Aang says: "What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?"
Koh says: "You've already met them, actually.  Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death,  good and evil, yin and yang."
Aang says: "The koi fish!  I must be going now."
Koh says: "We'll meet again."
Aang says: "The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world."
Roku says: "A friend is here, to guide you back."
Aang says: "Hei Bai!"
Zhao says: "We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there, we're going fishing."
