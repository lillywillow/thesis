Aang says: "What's happening‌?  Zuko, my fire went out."
Zuko says: "What do you want me to do‌?"
Aang says: "Give me some of yours."
Zuko says: "No, just make your own."
Aang says: "I can't."
Zuko says: "Get some from those warriors.  Hurry!  Stop cheating off me!"
Aang says: "Quit being stingy!"
Aang says: "Uh oh."
Zuko says: "These are the masters."
Aang says: "Still think we can take 'em?"
Zuko says: "Sshh. I never said that."
