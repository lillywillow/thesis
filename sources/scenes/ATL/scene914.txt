Canyon guide says: "Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall."
Aang says: "Why'd you do that?"
Canyon guide says: "These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now."
Sokka says: "We gotta help him!  Okay, now we gotta help me!"
Aang says: "What was that?"
Canyon guide says: "Canyon crawler.  And there's sure to be more!"
Katara says: "Your arms, they're broken!"
Canyon guide says: "Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words-"
Aang says: "We're trapped in this canyon."
Sokka says: "I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers."
Gan Jin leader says: "It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to."
Zhang leader says: "What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins!"
Gan Jin leader says: "I hope you're happy. We're stuck in this canyon with no way out."
Zhang leader says: "Why don't you thank yourself, food hider?"
Aang says: "Look, sticking together is the only way to-"
Zhang leader says: "I'm not walking another step with the likes of them!"
Gan Jin leader says: "Now there's something we can agree on."
Aang says: "Any ideas?"
Canyon guide says: "No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!"
Gan Jin leader says: "See! We're going to become part of the food chain because of you!"
Zhang leader says: "Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!"
Gan Jin leader says: "Gladly."
Aang says: "Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen.  We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines.  Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much."
