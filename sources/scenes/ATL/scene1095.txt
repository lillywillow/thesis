Zuko says: "Uncle, we have a problem.  One of the customers is on to us. Don't look now but there is a girl over there at the corner table.  She knows we're Fire Nation.  Didn't I say don't look?!"
Iroh says: "You're right, Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot. Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you."
Zuko says: "What?"
Jin says: "Thank you for the tea. What's your name?"
Zuko says: "My name's Lee. My uncle and I just moved here."
Jin says: "Hi Lee, my name's Jin. Thank you and ... well, I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime."
Iroh says: "He'd love to!"
Jin says: "Great. I'll meet you in front of the shop at sundown."
Jin says: "Hey. Well, look at you.  You look so cute."
Zuko says: "It took my uncle ten minutes to do my hair."
Jin says: "So, how do you like the city so far?"
Zuko says: "It's okay."
Jin says: "What do you like to do for fun?"
Zuko says: "Nothing."
Waiter says: "Excuse me, sir. Would you and your girlfriend care for dessertâ€Œ?"
Zuko says: "She is not my girlfriend!"
Zuko says: "You have ... quite an appetite for a girl."
Jin says: "Umm ... thanks? So, Lee, where were you and your uncle living before you came here?"
Zuko says: "Umm ... well, we've been traveling around for a long time."
Jin says: "Oh. Why were you traveling so much?"
Zuko says: "We were ... uh, part of this traveling circus."
Jin says: "Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess.  You juggled!"
Zuko says: "Yes, I juggled."
Jin says: "I've always wanted to learn how to juggle.  Can you show me something?"
Zuko says: "I haven't practiced for a while."
Jin says: "It's all right. Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in the city."
