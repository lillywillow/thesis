Zhao says: "So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over."
Aang says: "I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!"
Zhao says: "Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people?  Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.  See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely.  Blow all the wind you want, but your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress, and no one is coming to rescue you."
Sokka says: "Water ..."
Katara says: "Momo should be back any minute."
Katara says: "Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter!  Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?"
