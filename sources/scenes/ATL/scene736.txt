Tong says: "I find that hard to swallow,  considering what you did to us in your past life! It was Avatar Kyoshi; she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great."
Aang says: "You think that I ... murdered someone?"
Villager #2 says: "We used to be a great society before you killed our leader.  Now look at us!"
Aang says: "Huh!"
Katara says: "Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would.  And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!"
Villager #3 says: "Let's tell her what we all think of the Avatar's "honor"!"
Aang says: "Give me a chance to clear my name!"
Tong says: "The only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial."
Aang says: "I'll gladly stand trial!"
Tong says: "You'll have to follow all our rules. That includes paying bail."
Aang says: "No problem."
Aang says: "How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?"
