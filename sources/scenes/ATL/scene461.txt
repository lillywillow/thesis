Zuko says: "Finally!  Uncle, do you realize what this means?!"
Iroh says: "I won't get to finish my game?"
Zuko says: "It means my search is about to come to an end."
Zuko says: "That light came from an incredibly powerful source!  It has to be him!"
Iroh says: "Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.  I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.  Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?"
Zuko says: "I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!"
Sokka says: "Stop!"
Katara says: "Stop it!"
Aang says: "I need to ask you something ..."
Katara says: "What?"
Aang says: "Please ... come closer."
Katara says: "What is it?"
Aang says: "Will you go penguin sledding with me?"
Katara says: "Uh, sure ... I-I guess."
Aang says: "What's going on here?"
Sokka says: "You tell us!  How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?"
Aang says: "I'm not sure."
Aang says: "Appa! Are you all right?  Wake up, buddy."
Aang says: "Ha, ha! You're okay!"
Sokka says: "What is that thing?"
Aang says: "This is Appa, my flying bison."
Sokka says: "Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister."
Aang says: "Don't worry, it'll wash out.  So do you guys live around here?"
Sokka says: "Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!"
Katara says: "Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye.  The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name."
Aang says: "I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo!  I'm Aang."
Sokka says: "You just sneezed ...  and flew ten feet in the air!"
Aang says: "Really? It felt higher than that."
Katara says: "You're an airbender!"
Aang says: "Sure am!"
Sokka says: "Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ...  I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense."
Aang says: "Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift."
Katara says: "We'd love a ride! Thanks!"
Sokka says: "Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster!"
Katara says: "Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death?"
Aang says: "Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip!"
Aang says: "Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!"
Sokka says: "Wow, that was truly amazing ..."
Aang says: "Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see."
Katara says: "Why are you smiling at me like that?"
Aang says: "Oh, I was smiling?"
Iroh says: "I'm going to bed now.  Yep, a man needs his rest.  Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed."
Zuko says: "Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over."
