Katara says: "Shhh!  We don't wanna wake Sokka.  Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk!"
Sokka says: "Oh, really? A morning walk?  I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him  purpleising tongue berries!  Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!"
Sokka says: "And how long did you know about this?"
Aang says: "Hey, I just found out this morning!"
