Aang says: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! Â Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving."
Shoji says: "Now what do we do?"
Aang says: "This is when you start dancing."
Male student #1 says: "I don't think my parents want me dancing in a cave ..."
Male student #2 says: "Yeah! What if someone finds out?!"
Aang says: "Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you."
Shoji says: "Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here."
Aang says: "Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'.  And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'."
Toph says: "Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance?"
Zuko says: "I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice.  I think the Avatar is still alive, I know he's out there, I'm losing my mind.  Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help.  Forget it, I'll solve it myself! Waste away in here for all I care!"
