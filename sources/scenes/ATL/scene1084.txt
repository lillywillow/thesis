Third girl says: "Good one, Star."
Katara says: "Let's go, Toph."
Toph says: "No, no, that was a good one. Like your poodle monkey.  You know what else is a good one?"
Katara says: "Now that was funny."
Katara says: "Those girls don't know what they're talking about."
Toph says: "It's okay. One of the good things about being blind, is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearance.  I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am."
Katara says: "That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured.  And I know it doesn't matter, but ...  You're really pretty."
Toph says: "I am?"
Katara says: "Yeah, you are."
Toph says: "I'd return the compliment, but I've no idea how you look like.  Thank you, Katara."
Katara says: "Ow!"
