Long Feng says: "Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you.  I am Long Feng, Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li. I'd like to talk to you. Your friends will be waiting for us in the library."
Sokka says: "Why won't you let us talk to the king? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!"
Long Feng says: "The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles and the day to day minutia of military activities."
Aang says: "This could be the most important thing he's ever heard."
Long Feng says: "What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se. All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters. It's my job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military."
Katara says: "So the king is just a figurehead."
Toph says: "He's your puppet!"
Long Feng says: "Oh, no, no. His Majesty is an icon, a god to his people. He can't sully his hands with the hourly change of an endless war."
Sokka says: "But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion ..."
Long Feng says: "Enough! I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan.  It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls.  Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic."
Jet says: "You have to believe me, they're firebenders! They won't stop until they win the War."
Dai Li agent says: "Calm down, you're safe now."
Long Feng says: "Our economy would be ruined, our peaceful way of life – our traditions – would disappear."
