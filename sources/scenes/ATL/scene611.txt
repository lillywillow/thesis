Aang says: "Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here."
Sokka says: "I guess that's why."
Xin Fu says: "Welcome to Earth Rumble VI! I am your host, Xin Fu!"
Katara says: "This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it?"
Sokka says: "That's what I paid for."
Xin Fu says: "The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring, and you win!  Round one: The Boulder vs. The Big Bad Hippo!"
The Boulder says: "Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad!  The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide!"
The Hippo says: "Hippo ... mad!"
Xin Fu says: "Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking the boat!"
Xin Fu says: "The Boulder wins!"
Katara says: "How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves."
Aang says: "I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?"
Xin Fu says: "Next match ... The Boulder versus  Fire Nation Man!"
Fire Nation Man says: "Please, to rise for Fire Nation national anthem!  Fire Lord, my flame burns  for thee!"
Sokka says: "Go back to the Fire Nation!"
Fire Nation Man says: "No, no, please!"
