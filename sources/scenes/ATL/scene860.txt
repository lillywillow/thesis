Toph says: "Don't make me put this down!"
Ghashiun says: "Put a muzzle on him!"
Toph says: "I'm sorry, Appa."
Ghashiun says: "Ransack his saddle. Who knows what treasures are stashed in there!"
Ghashiun says: "He's tied up good. He can't hurt you."
Sandbender #1 says: "What's your father gonna do when he finds out we lost a sand-sailer?"
Ghashiun says: "Nothing. It's the one we stole from the Hami Tribe.  Did you empty the saddle?  That's it? Nothing but garbage!"
Sandbender #2 says: "Doesn't matter. We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants."
Merchant #1 says: "How's his temper?"
Ghashiun says: "Uh, pretty good.  Most of the time."
Merchant #2 says: "I bet someone will pay a fortune for him in Ba Sing Se."
Merchant #1 says: "All right, you've got a deal."
