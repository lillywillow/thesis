Aang says: "I think I like "the man with a sword for a hand" better."
Toph says: "Water Tribe slumber parties must stink."
Katara says: "No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story."
Sokka says: "Is this one of those "a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to" stories?"
Katara says: "No, it happened to Mom."
Katara says: "One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home.  Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice.  "It's so cold and I can't get warm!"  Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone."
Sokka says: "Where'd she go?"
Katara says: "No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm."
Toph says: "Wait! Guys, did you hear that?  I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming."
Sokka says: "Pfft! Nice try."
Toph says: "No, I'm serious. I hear something."
Katara says: "You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ..."
Toph says: "It just ... stopped."
Aang says: "All right, now I'm getting scared."
Hama says: "Hello, children."
Hama says: "Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama.  You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night.  I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?"
Sokka says: "Yes, please."
