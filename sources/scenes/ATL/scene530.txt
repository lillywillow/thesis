Katara says: "You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food?"

Aang says: "So that's where my friends and I would play airball,  and over there  is where the bison would sleep, and ..."
Katara says: "What's wrong?"
Aang says: "This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds.  I can't believe how much things have changed."
Sokka says: "So uh, this airball game. How do you play?"
Aang says: "Aang, seven!  Sokka, zero!"
