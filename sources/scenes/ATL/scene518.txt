Arnook says: "Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar."
Pakku says: "Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment."
Aang says: "My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days."
Pakku says: "If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night."
Zuko says: "For the last time, I'm not playing the tsungi horn!"
Iroh says: "No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem."
Zhao says: "I'm taking your crew."
Zuko says: "What?!"
Zhao says: "I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole."
Zuko says: "Uncle, is that true?"
Iroh says: "I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone ...  even the cook."
Zhao says: "Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again."
Iroh says: "No!"
Zhao says: "I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko."
Zuko says: "I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative."
Zhao says: "Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?"
Iroh says: "Just rumors. I don't think he is real."
Zhao says: "He's real, all right.  He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands ... if you change your mind."
Katara says: "I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!"
Aang says: "Good morning, Master Pakku!"
Pakku says: "No, please, march right in. I'm not concentrating or anything."
Aang says: "Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?"
Pakku says: "I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending."
