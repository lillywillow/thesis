Sokka says: "Would you sit down?  If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?"
Aang says: "It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives."
Sokka says: "Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer."
Aang says: "I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?"
Katara says: "Calm down, it's going to be okay.  If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know."
Aang says: "You'd do that?"
Katara says: "We'll need to find a good source of water first."
Sokka says: "Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in."
