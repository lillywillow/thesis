Katara says: "It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope."
Sokka says: "We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?"
Chong says: "Uh, about two hours each."
Lily says: "And we have five torches, so that's ten hours!"
Sokka says: "It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!"
Lily says: "Oh, right."
Sokka says: "I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through."
