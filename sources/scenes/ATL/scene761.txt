Aang says: "Invasion. All aboard for the invasion."
Katara says: "You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?"
Aang says: "I told you, I can't go back to sleep."
Katara says: "Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you."
Aang says: "Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara."
Katara says: "What big things?"
Aang says: "I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this.  I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love.  I'm doing it for you, Katara."
Katara says: "Aang, what are you saying?"
Aang says: "I'm saying, I love you!"
Katara says: "What are we doing?"
Aang says: "What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby,  you're my forever girl."
Katara says: "Aang!  I was just saying you should take a nap."
Aang says: "Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream."
Katara says: "What was your dream about?"
Aang says: "Uh, living underwater?"
Katara says: "Sounds neat!"
