Roku says: "I was stuck in the Avatar State.  I could see my body, but I couldn't control it.  Luckily, Fire Sage Kaja was wiser than I, and he knew how to break the Avatar State's hold on me."
Young Roku says: "What happened?  Cough! Cough!"
Kaja says: "Looks like we have a lot more training to do ... after you rebuild the temple."
Roku says: "I see my own impatience in you, Aang. Do not be too hard on yourself. You will master the Avatar State, as I finally did.  Look for Avatar Kyoshi in the place where Hei Bai sleeps!"
Aang says: "... what?"
Aang says: "Hei Bai!  Roku told me I'd find you here!"
Hei Bai says: "Rraaaawww!"
Aang says: "I'm happy to see you too. I don't suppose you've seen Avatar Kyoshi around, have you?  There she is!"
