Katara says: "Hey."
Aang says: "Hey. What'cha thinkin' about?"
Katara says: "I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar?"
Aang says: "Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry."
Katara says: "Okay. Just curious.  Good night."
Aang says: "Sleep tight."
