Azula says: "What am I holding?"
Banished servant says: "A cherry pit, Princess."
Azula says: "Correct. And what day is this?"
Banished servant says: "It is the day of your coronation."
Azula says: "Yes, it is. So, please. Tell me why, on the most important day of my life, you've decided to leave a pit in my cherry?"
Banished servant says: "It wasn't a decision; it was just a small mistake."
Azula says: "Small? Do you realize what could've happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?"
Banished servant says: "I suppose you could've ... choked?"
Azula says: "Yes, then you will understand the severity of your crime."
Banished servant says: "I understand, Princess. Please, forgive me."
Azula says: "Oh very well, since it is a special day, I will show mercy. You are banished. Leave this palace immediately."
Azula says: "What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes. I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene."
