Toph says: "So ... you like ... flying?  Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet.  But this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy.  Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy."
