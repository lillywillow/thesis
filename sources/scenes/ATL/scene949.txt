Sokka says: "How did you guys get out?"
Aang says: "Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way."
Sokka says: "Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way."
Katara says: "Why is your forehead all red?"
Chong says: "Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar!"
Aang says: "So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us?"
Moku says: "Nope."
Aang says: "Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku."
Chong says: "Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey."
Sokka says: "Just play your songs."
Chong says: "Hey! Good plan!  Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Da, da, da ..."
