Aang says: "Do you feel anything down there?"
Toph says: "Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano."
Sokka says: "Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?"
Toph says: "There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano."
Sokka says: "Sounds like a secret bunker to me."
Aang says: "Stay safe. We'll be back soon."
Toph says: "This way! That one's a dead end!"
Sokka says: "What would we do without you?"
Toph says: "Perish in burning hot magma."
Sokka says: "Yeah, pretty much."
Toph says: "The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker."
Sokka says: "We'll have to be fast, but careful."
Aang says: "How is that careful?"
Sokka says: "I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky."
Sokka says: "There's no floor. It's just a river of lava."
Aang says: "Climb aboard and hold on tight."
