Azula says: "My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord, and have brought shame on all of us. You might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed."
Captain says: "Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship into port before nightfall."
Azula says: "I'm sorry, captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Could you explain something to me?"
Captain says: "Of course, Your Highness."
Azula says: "Do the tides command this ship?"
Captain says: "I'm afraid I don't understand."
Azula says: "You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in.  Do the tides command this ship?"
Captain says: "No, princess."
Azula says: "And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?"
Captain says: "No, princess."
Azula says: "Well then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over."
Captain says: "I'll pull us in."
