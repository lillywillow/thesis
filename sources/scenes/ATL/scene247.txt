Sokka says: "That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something."
Katara says: "That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay.  She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran."
Sokka says: "But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"?"
Katara says: "Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?"
Sokka says: "I'm gonna take a look around."
Katara says: "Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing?  You can't just snoop around someone's house."
Sokka says: "It'll be fine."
Aang says: "She could be home any minute."
Katara says: "Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!"
Sokka says: "I'm not finished yet.  Come on ..."
Aang says: "Okay, that's pretty creepy."
Katara says: "So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that.  Sokka, you've looked enough.  Hama will be back soon."
Sokka says: "Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here?"
Katara says: "Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!"
Sokka says: "We'll see.  It's empty, except for a little chest."
Toph says: "Maybe it's treasure!"
Katara says: "Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room!"
Sokka says: "I have to see what's in there."
Aang says: "We shouldn't be doing this."
Sokka says: "Maybe there's a key here somewhere ..."
Toph says: "Ooh! Hand it over!"
Sokka says: "Come on, come on!"
Toph says: "This isn't as easy as it looks!"
Aang says: "Guys, I don't know about this ..."
Katara says: "This is crazy! I'm leaving!"
Sokka says: "Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!"
Hama says: "I'll tell you what's in the box."
Sokka says: "An old comb?"
Hama says: "It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe."
Katara says: "You're from the Southern Water Tribe?"
Hama says: "Just like you."
Katara says: "How did you know?"
Hama says: "I heard you talking around your campfire."
Sokka says: "But why didn't you tell us?"
Hama says: "I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough."
Aang says: "Great ..."
Katara says: "I knew I felt a bond with you right away."
Sokka says: "And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.  But I'm sorry we were sneaking around."
Hama says: "Apology accepted.  Now, let's get cooking!"
