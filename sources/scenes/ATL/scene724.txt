Katara says: "Why did they throw you in here?  Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!"
Katara says: "You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!"
Zuko says: "You don't know what you're talking about!"
Katara says: "I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through!  Me personally!  The Fire Nation took my mother away from me."
Zuko says: "I'm sorry.  That's something we have in common."
