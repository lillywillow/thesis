Yue says: "Why is he sitting like that?"
Katara says: "He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World.  It takes all his concentration."
Yue says: "Is there any way we can help?"
Aang says: "How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying!"
Yue says: "Is he okay?"
Katara says: "He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.  That's his way back to the physical world."
Yue says: "Maybe we should get some help."
Katara says: "No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him."
Zuko says: "Well, aren't you a big girl now."
Katara says: "No ..."
Zuko says: "Yes. Hand him over and I won't have to hurt you."
