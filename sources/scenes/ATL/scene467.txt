Katara says: "I haven't done this since I was a kid!"
Aang says: "You still are a kid!"
Aang says: "Whoa! What is that?"
Katara says: "A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people.  Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!"
Aang says: "If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear."
Katara says: "This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl.  It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks."
Aang says: "Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation.  I've never seen any war."
Katara says: "Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?"
Aang says: "I don't know. A few days, maybe?"
Katara says: "I think it was more like a hundred years!"
Aang says: "What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?"
Katara says: "Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time!  It's the only explanation."
Aang says: "A hundred years!  I can't believe it."
Katara says: "I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ..."
Aang says: "I did get to meet you."
Katara says: "Come on, let's get out of here."
Katara says: "Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy."
Aang says: "Huh?"
Aang says: "What's that you said about booby traps?"
Aang says: "Uh oh ...  Hold on tight!"
Katara says: "Aaah!"
