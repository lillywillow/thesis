Scary prisoner says: "You got a bald head.  Some nice tattoos.  You're going to fit in real well around here."
Koko says: "Where's Aangy?"
Katara says: "He couldn't be here, Koko."
Koko says: "I wanted to see Aangy ..."
Katara says: "Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life."
Sokka says: "They say it was Kyoshi."
Oyaji says: "Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name."
Sokka says: "So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?"
Oyaji says: "Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world."
Sokka says: "Oh, well ... that's great."
Oyaji says: "This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono."
Katara says: "She had exquisite taste."
Oyaji says: "Please don't touch!"
Sokka says: "These fans ...  They were her weapons, no?"
Oyaji says: "Also refrain from touching the fans."
Katara says: "These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!"
Oyaji says: "The biggest of any Avatar."
Katara says: "Wait a minute ... big feet?  Little footprint?  There's no wayâ€“"
Sokka says: "Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?"
Katara says: "You're right. I'm sorry.  Please."
Sokka says: "Aha!  There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint.  And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene."
Katara says: "Brilliant, Sokka."
