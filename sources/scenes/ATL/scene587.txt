Katara says: "We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate."
Smellerbee says: "Jet, we need to talk."
Jet says: "What‌? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been‌?  I could use some help with surveillance here!"
Smellerbee says: "We've been talking,  and we think you're becoming obsessed with this. It's not healthy."
Jet says: "Oh, really? You both think this?"
Smellerbee says: "We came here to make a fresh start. But you won't let this go. Even though there is no real proof!"
Jet says: "Well, maybe if you'd help me!"
Smellerbee says: "Jet, you gotta stop this."
Jet says: "Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over.  Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless‌. How they wiped out all the people we loved. If you don't want to help me, I'll get the evidence on my own."
