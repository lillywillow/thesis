Jet says: "So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?"
Tea seller says: "Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!"
Iroh says: "Ooh! Jasmine please."
Iroh says: "Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!"
Jet says: "Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Jet says: "You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters?"
Zuko says: "Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang."
Jet says: "Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees."
Zuko says: "I said no."
Jet says: "Have it your way."
Iroh says: "Hey!"
Zuko says: "What are you doing firebending your tea? For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move!"
Iroh says: "I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ...  it's just so sad!"
