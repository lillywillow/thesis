Sokka says: "This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up."
Kay-fon says: "If anyone can save us, he can."
Sokka says: "He still shouldn't have to face this alone."
Aang says: "The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace.  Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then."
Aang says: "You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is–"
Aang says: "My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up!  Uhhh ..."
Senlin Village leader says: "The Avatar's methods are ... unusual."
Sokka says: "It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him."
Kay-fon says: "No. Only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei Bai."
Katara says: "Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka."
Aang says: "Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would you please turn around?  I command you to turn around now!"
Sokka says: "That's it. He needs help."
Katara says: "Sokka, wait!"
Senlin Village leader says: "It's not safe!"
Sokka says: "Hei Bai, over here!"
Aang says: "Sokka, go back!"
Sokka says: "We'll fight him together, Aang."
Aang says: "I don't want to fight him unless I–"
Katara says: "Sokka!"
Zuko says: "Uncle! Uncle, where are you?"
Fire Nation Soldier says: "Sir, maybe he thought you left without him."
Zuko says: "Something's not right here. That pile of rocks."
Fire Nation Soldier says: "It looks like there's been a landslide, sir."
Zuko says: "Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally.  My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!"
Sokka says: "Aang! Over here! Help!"
Aang says: "Hang on, Sokka!"
Aang says: "Sokka!  I failed."
