Kuruk says: "I was arrogant, proud, and boastful ... I never thought about settling down until I met the love of my life.  We met during the New Moon Celebration, when the sister tribes would come together as one.  It was love at first sight.  Her name was Ummi. She was from the Southern Tribe. And she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.  With Ummi in my life, I decided to change my irresponsible ways and settle down."
