Suki says: "Spit it out! What do you want?"
Sokka says: "I would be honored if you would teach me."
Suki says: "Even if I'm a girl?"
Sokka says: "I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was ... wrong."
Suki says: "We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys."
Sokka says: "Please make an exception.  I won't let you down."
Suki says: "All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions."
Sokka says: "Of course!"
Suki says: "And I mean all of them."
Sokka says: "Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little ...  girly."
Suki says: "It's a warrior's uniform, you should be proud.  The silk threads symbolize the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart."
