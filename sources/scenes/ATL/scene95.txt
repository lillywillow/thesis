Ming says: "Lunchtime, General Iroh.  And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice."
Iroh says: "Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable.  I think you should take the rest of the day off."
Ming says: "What?"
Iroh says: "You don't look well. Maybe you should go home and rest."
Ming says: "No, I feel fine."
Iroh says: "Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon."
