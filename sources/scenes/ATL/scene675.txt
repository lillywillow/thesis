Toph says: "Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is that we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love."

Katara says: "What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug."
Sokka says: "It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and  making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay?  I can't do anything."
Katara says: "That's not true. No one can read a map like you."
Toph says: "I can't read at all!"
Aang says: "Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time?  I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?"

Sokka says: "You do?"
