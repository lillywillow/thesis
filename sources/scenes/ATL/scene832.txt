Ozai says: "You've been away for a long time. I see the weight of your travels has changed you. You have redeemed yourself, my son.  Welcome home."
Bato says: "I'll leave you two alone."
Hakoda says: "What's wrong, Katara?"
Katara says: "He left."
Hakoda says: "What?"
Katara says: "Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility."
Hakoda says: "Maybe that's his way of being brave."
Katara says: "It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind?"
Hakoda says: "You're talking about me too, aren't you?"
Katara says: "How could you leave us, Dad?  I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you."
Hakoda says: "I'm so sorry, Katara."
Katara says: "I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt!"
Hakoda says: "I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache."
