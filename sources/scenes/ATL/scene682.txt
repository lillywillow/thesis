Piandao says: "Sokka. That's an unusual name."
Sokka says: "Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name ... for Fire Nation colonials."
Piandao says: "Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from the master."
Sokka says: "Well, actually, I've been all over the world."
Piandao says: "Yep, here we go."
Sokka says: "And I know one thing for sure:  I have a lot to learn."
Piandao says: "You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself."
Sokka says: "I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth.  But the truth is ... I don't know if I am worthy."
Piandao says: "Hm, I see.  Well, then,  let's find out together how worthy you are."
Piandao says: "I will train you."
Piandao says: "The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself.  You must think of it as another part of your own body."
Sokka says: "Like a second head."
Piandao says: "Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm.  The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes  the most versatile of weapons,  and just as the imagination is limitless,  so too are the possibilities of the sword."
Aang says: "What should we do todayâ€Œ?"
