Zuko says: "This isn't fair! Everyone else seems to trust me now! What is it with you?"
Katara says: "Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you!  Remember, back in Ba Sing Se.  And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!"
Zuko says: "What can I do to make it up to you?"
Katara says: "You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.  Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!"
