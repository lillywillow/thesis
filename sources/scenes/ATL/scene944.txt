Sokka says: "At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku."
Chong says: "Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're thinking of ideas‌? Because I've had an idea for, like, an hour now."
Sokka says: "Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!"
Chong says: "Well, then listen to this: If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song!"
Aang says: "How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?"
Katara says: "I have a crazy idea."
Aang says: "What?"
Katara says: "Never mind. It's too crazy."
Aang says: "Katara, what is it?"
Katara says: "I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ..."
Aang says: "Right ..."
Katara says: "And here, it says, "Love is brightest in the dark," and has a picture of them kissing."
Aang says: "Where are you going with this?"
Katara says: "Well, what if we ... kissed?"
Aang says: "Us ... kissing‌?"
Katara says: "See? It was a crazy idea."
Aang says: "Us ... kissing ..."
Katara says: "Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that‌?"
Aang says: "Yeah.  I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you!"
Katara says: "Oh, well! I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.  Sorry I suggested it!"
Aang says: "No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying ..."
Katara says: "Ugh!"
Aang says: "What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment."
Katara says: "Well, I'm not sure which I'd rather do!"
Aang says: "What is wrong with me ..."
