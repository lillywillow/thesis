Azula says: "The Earth King and the Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.  This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government.  If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all,  I will snuff it out.  That is all."
Ty Lee says: "Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way."
Mai says: "Yeah. I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants."
Azula says: "There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle."
