Bato says: "After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior,  these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat."
Mother Superior says: "Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey."
Aang says: "Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything-"
Sokka says: "What smells so good, Bato?"
Bato says: "The sisters craft ointments and perfumes."
Sokka says: "Perfume?  Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much.  Am I right?"
Bato says: "You have your father's wit."
