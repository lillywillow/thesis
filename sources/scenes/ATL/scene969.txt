Wu says: "And you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye-bye now."
Katara says: "Okay, okay, but one more thing."
Wu says: "All right, what is it?"
Katara says: "Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?"
Wu says: "Papaya!"
Katara says: "Aww, I hate papaya."
Aang says: "Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there."
Katara says: "Hey, Aang."
Aang says: "That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff."
Katara says: "Ugh, papaya please."
