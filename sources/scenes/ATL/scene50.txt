Jee says: "I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident."
Iroh says: "It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor."
Jee says: "So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal."
Iroh says: "Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope."
