Katara says: "Aang, look!"
Aang says: "We found the exit!"
Katara says: "This isn't the exit."
Aang says: "No. It's a tomb."
Aang says: "It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here."
Katara says: "These pictures tell their story."
Katara says: "They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ..."
Katara says: "The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ...  but their love was strong and they found a way."
Katara says: "The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders."
Katara says: "They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly.  Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth.  But, one day, the man didn't come  - he'd died in the war between the two villages.  Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ...  but, instead, she declared the war over.  Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.  The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu.  The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love."
Katara says: "Love is brightest  in the dark."
Moku says: "Oh, great! Your plans have led us to another dead end!"
