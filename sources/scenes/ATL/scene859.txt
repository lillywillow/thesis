Katara says: "Oh.  So dad's probably long gone."
Sokka says: "I wonder why they left this boat? There's nothing wrong with it."
Aang says: "When was the last time you saw your dad?"
Sokka says: "I don't want to talk about it."
Aang says: "Sorry.  I didn't mean to bring that up."
Katara says: "It's okay Aang. Our dad left about two years ago, with all the other Water Tribe men."
Sokka says: "Maybe we should all get some sleep."
