Li says: "Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your servants?"
Lo says: "All your Dai Li agents ..."
Li says: "And the Imperial Firebenders?"
Azula says: "None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did."
Lo and Li says: "Azula, we are concerned for you and your well-being."
Azula says: "My father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't heâ€Œ? He thinks I can't handle the responsibility of being Fire Lord. But I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history."
Lo says: "I'm sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today ..."
Li says: "Perhaps it's best if you postponed your coronation."
Azula says: "What? Which one of you just said that?"
Azula says: "What a shame ... there's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai!"
Lo says: "But ..."
Lo and Li says: "We're not firebenders."
Azula says: "All right, fine.  Lo, you're banished.  Li, you can stay."
Li says: "But, I'm Li. So who's banished?"
