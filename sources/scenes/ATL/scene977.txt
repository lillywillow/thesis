Sokka says: "Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong!"
Village Woman says: "Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover."
Katara says: "If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes."
Calm man says: "Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears."
Aang says: "Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction,  you have to take fate into your own hands!"
Sokka says: "Look!  Can your fortune telling explain that?"
