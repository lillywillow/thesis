Aang says: "Ta-dah! Normal kid."
Toph says: "Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well.  Sorry, shoes!  Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender."
Katara says: "How do I look?"
Aang says: "Uh ... your mom's necklace."
Katara says: "Oh,  oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it?"
Aang says: "I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, "stay flamin'".  Greetings, my good hotman."
Fire Nation man says: "Uh, hi.  I guess ..."
Aang says: "Oh, we're going to a meat place?"
Sokka says: "Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat!"
Aang says: "You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage.  Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman."
Male soldier says: "It's over. We caught you."
Aang says: "Who, me?"
Male soldier says: "It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here.  Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform."
Kwan says: "Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding?"
Aang says: "That's right.  Let the molding begin."
Kwan says: "Wait a minute.  You're not from the Fire Nation.  Clearly you're from the colonies."
Aang says: "Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom."
Kwan says: "Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders.  Like so."
Aang says: "Sorry, ma'am."
Kwan says: "And we don't wear head coverings indoors."
Aang says: "Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing."
Kwan says: "Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you "Mannerless Colony Slob"?"
Aang says: "Just "slob" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon."
Aang says: "We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun."
On Ji says: "Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey."
Aang says: "What monkey?"
On Ji says: "Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way."
Hide says: "On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid."
Aang says: "Wow.  You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about."
Hide says: "That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly.  On Ji is my girlfriend.  Don't forget it."
Aang says: "It was nice meeting you."
Shoji says: "I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little."
Aang says: "I guess I'm just lucky."
Shoji says: "We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come?"
Aang says: "I'd love to."
Katara says: "Where have you been? We've been worried sick."
Aang says: "I got invited to play with some kids after school."
Sokka says: "After what?!"
Aang says: "I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow."
Sokka says: "Enrolled in what?!"
