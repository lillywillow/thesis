Aang says: "What's the matter, buddy?  It's her!  Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!"
Aang says: "Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule.  Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine!  I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends!  Heeey!  My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar."
Katara says: "Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy."
Aang says: "Yeah, me too. I hate that.  You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive."
Katara says: "Thank you, but-"
Aang says: "You seem familiar too."
Katara says: "A lot of people say that."
Aang says: "No, you really seem familiar."
Katara says: "Look, I really should get going."
Aang says: "Katara?"
Katara says: "Hi, Aang."
Aang says: "You're the Painted Lady?  But how?"
Katara says: "I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village.  But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her."
Aang says: "So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick?"
Katara says: "He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine!"
Aang says: "I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people."
Katara says: "I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ..."
Aang says: "No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero!"
Katara says: "Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do."
Aang says: "You wanna destroy this factory?"
Katara says: "Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently."
