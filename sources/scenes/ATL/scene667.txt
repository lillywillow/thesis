Due says: "How you like that possum chicken?"
Sokka says: "Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?  You've got plenty of those big things wandering around."
Due says: "You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!"
Sokka says: "Nice Slim!"
Due says: "Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food."
Tho says: "Where'd you say you was from?"
Katara says: "The South Pole."
Tho says: "Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?"
Katara says: "No, it's all ice and snow."
Tho says: "Hmm. No wonder you left."
Sokka says: "Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.  Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp."
Katara says: "What about the visions?"
Sokka says: "I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!"
Aang says: "But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?"
Sokka says: "That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.  The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down."
Huu says: "I can't do anything like that. I just bend the water in the plants."
Sokka says: "Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp."
