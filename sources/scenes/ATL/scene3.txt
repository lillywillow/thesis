Head of Dai Li says: "You sent for us, Princess. Is everything all right?"
Azula says: "Actually, everything's not all right! Do you know how long it took you to get here?"
Head of Dai Li says: "Uh ... a few minutes, I guess."
Azula says: "Five, to be precise, in which time an assassin could've snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way!"
Head of Dai Li says: "My apologies, Princess."
Azula says: "Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty?"
Head of Dai Li says: "The Dai Li would never betray you!"
Azula says: "And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me!  You're all banished!"
Head of Dai Li says: "But ..."
Azula says: "Goodbye!"
Azula says: "Please send in the next group on your way out!"
Sokka says: "Sshhh ..."
Toph says: "That's how it's done!"
Sokka says: "Good work, Toph! Time to take control of the ship, take the wheel."
Toph says: "That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship!"
Sokka says: "I was talking to Suki."
Toph says: "That would make a lot more sense."
Suki says: "What are we going to do about the rest of the crew?"
Sokka says: "Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea.  Attention, crew, this is your captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate."
Qin Lee says: "Hey, I'm Qin Lee. I work up in communications."
Engineer says: "Oh, hi. I work down in the engine room. That's probably why we never met before. Big airship, you know?"
Qin Lee says: "Yep."
Engineer says: "So, do you know whose birthday it is?"
Crew member says: "I can't believe the captain remembered my birthday! He really does care!"
Engineer says: "Happy birthday."
Sokka says: "Fire Lord Ozai, here we come."
