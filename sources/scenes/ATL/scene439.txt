Aang says: "Appa's exhausted."
Sokka says: "Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep."
Katara says: "Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier,  if Toph didn't have such issues."
Toph says: "What!?"
Aang says: "All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest."
Toph says: "No, I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues?"
Katara says: "I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep  and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!"
