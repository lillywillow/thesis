Kay-fon says: "This young person is the Avatar!"
Senlin Village leader says: "So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence."
Aang says: "Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with?"
Senlin Village leader says: "I'm not sure ..."
Kay-fon says: "Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope!  For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit."
Sokka says: "Why is it attacking you?"
Senlin Village leader says: "We do not know, but each of the last three nights, he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near."
Katara says: "What happens then?"
Kay-fon says: "As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the Spirit World grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely."
Senlin Village leader says: "Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen."
Aang says: "So, what do you want me to do, exactly?"
Kay-fon says: "Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits."
Aang says: "Right ... that's me."
Katara says: "Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second?  Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this."
Aang says: "Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!"
Katara says: "So ... can you help these people?"
Aang says: "I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me."
Katara says: "I think you can do it, Aang."
Sokka says: "Yeah.  We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster."
