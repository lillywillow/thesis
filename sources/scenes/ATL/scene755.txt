Katara says: "These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up.  Reach for the sun.  Feel your chi paths clearing.  Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?"
Aang says: "I feel ... really warm."
Katara says: "Good, good. Go on."
Aang says: "Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat.  Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames!"
Katara says: "Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out."
