Aang says: "Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!"
Air Nomad boy #2 says: "Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters!"
Aang says: "Great!  What's going on?"
Air Nomad boy #1 says: "Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on."
Aang says: "But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play?"
Air Nomad boy #1 says: "That's the only fair way."
Aang says: "Oh, okay."
Air Nomad boy #2 says: "Sorry, Aang."
Air Nomad boy #1 says: "Okay. Now, who wants Jinju on their team?"
