Jet says: "I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us."
Smellerbee says: "You don't know anything about him, Jet."
Jet says: "I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender."
Smellerbee says: "Besides, I thought we were going straight now."
Jet says: "We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think, Longshot?"
Jet says: "I can respect that."
General Sung says: "What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured."
Katara says: "His chi is blocked.  Who did this to you?"
Terra Team member says: "Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away."
Katara says: "Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside."
Sokka says: "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh!"
Katara says: "Yes?"
Sokka says: "What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders!"
Toph says: "By hitting its pressure points!"
Aang says: "We'll take it down from the inside."
