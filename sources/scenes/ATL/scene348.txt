Sokka says: "What about, "I'm sorry?""
Suki says: "For what?"
Sokka says: "I treated you like a girl when I should've treated you like a warrior."
Suki says: "I am a warrior.  But I'm a girl, too.  Now get out of here! We'll hold them off."
Aang says: "Appa, yip yip!"
Zuko says: "Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!"
Katara says: "I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.  Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.  They're going to be okay, Aang."
Katara says: "What are you doing?"
