Aang says: "Give up!  You're outnumbered!"
Hama says: "No!  You've outnumbered yourselves."
Sokka says: "Katara, look out!  It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!"
Aang says: "This feels weird!"
Katara says: "I'm sorry, Aang!"
Aang says: "It's okay!"
Hama says: "Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other!"
Katara says: "No!"
