Iroh says: "It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack.  The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak."
Zhao says: "Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is."
Yue says: "They've stopped firing."
Katara says: "Aang!"
Aang says: "I can't do it ... I can't do it."
Katara says: "What happened?"
Aang says: "I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all."
Yue says: "But, you have to. You're the Avatar."
Aang says: "I'm just one kid."
