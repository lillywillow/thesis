Song says: "You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the White Jade, much less make it into tea and drink it."
Iroh says: "Whoops!"
Song says: "So where are you traveling from?"
Zuko says: "Yes, we're travelers."
Song says: "Do you have names?"
Zuko says: "Names? Of course we have names.  I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi?"
Iroh says: "Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior."
Song says: "Mushi and Junior, huh. My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal.  Why don't you stay for dinner?"
Zuko says: "Sorry, but we need to be moving on."
Song says: "That's too bad.  My mom always makes too much roast duck."
Iroh says: "Where do you live exactly?"
