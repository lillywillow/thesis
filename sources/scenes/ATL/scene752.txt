Zuko says: "Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be?"
Mai says: "Hm ... A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top."
Zuko says: "You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen."
Mai says: "That would be impressive."
Zuko says: "Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top?"
Servant says: "Excellent choice, sir."
Mai says: "I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty.  Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like that all-day war meeting coming up."
Zuko says: "War meeting? What are you talking about?"
Mai says: "Azula mentioned something. I-I assumed you were going, too."
Zuko says: "I guess I wasn't invited."
