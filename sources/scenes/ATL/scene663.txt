Aang says: "Who are you?"
Sokka says: "What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!"
Katara says: "Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!"
Aang says: "I was chasing some girl."
Katara says: "What girl?"
Aang says: "I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress."
Sokka says: "Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!"
Katara says: "I thought I saw Mom."
Sokka says: "Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here."
Katara says: "You saw something too?"
Sokka says: "I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot."
Aang says: "What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here."
Katara says: "Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?"
Aang says: "Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it."
Sokka says: "It's just a tree.  It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here."
