Herbalist says: "Hands off!"
Aang says: "Ow!"
Herbalist says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Aang says: "Taking the cure to my friends."
Herbalist says: "This isn't a cure! It's Miyuki's dinner. Plum blossom is her favorite."
Aang says: "What about my friends?"
Herbalist says: "Well, all they need are some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty down in the valley swamp."
Aang says: "What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?"
Herbalist says: "Why, suck on them of course!"
Aang says: "Suck on them?"
Herbalist says: "The frog skin excretes a substance that will cure your friends. Be sure to get plenty because once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!"
Aang says: "You're insane, aren't you?"
Herbalist says: "That's right! Well, don't stand there all day! Go!"
Aang says: "Uh ... I think you dropped this ...  A frog!"
