Aang says: "I'm comin' for ya, buddy.  He's here; I can feel it."
Joo Dee says: "Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?"
Sokka says: "Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately."
Joo Dee says: "Great! Let's begin our tour. And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it!"
Sokka says: "Ugh!  Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important."
Joo Dee says: "You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here."
Joo Dee says: "This is the Lower Ring."
Katara says: "What's that wall for?"
Joo Dee says: "Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside, that help maintain order.  This is where our newest arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands.  It's so quaint and lively!"
