Yue says: "The legends say the moon was the first waterbender.  Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves."
Katara says: "I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night."
Yue says: "Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean.  They work together to keep balance."
Aang says: "The spirits!  Maybe I can find them and get their help!"
Yue says: "How can you do that?"
Katara says: "The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them!"
Yue says: "Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!"
Aang says: "Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!  Or wisdom. That's good, too."
Katara says: "The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?"
Yue says: "I have an idea. Follow me."
Aang says: "So, is this the way to the Spirit World?"
Yue says: "No. You'll have to get there on your own.  But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole."
Aang says: "I never thought I'd miss grass this much!"
Katara says: "It's so warm here! How is that possible?"
Yue says: "It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land."
Aang says: "You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil."
Zuko says: "Be quiet!"
Arnook says: "Is something wrong, Sokka?"
Sokka says: "Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine."
Arnook says: "Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you."
Sokka says: "What, you want me to scrub the barracks?"
Arnook says: "I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue."
Sokka says: "Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard."
