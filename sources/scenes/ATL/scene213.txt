Soldier says: "He's too dangerous, Captain! We just can't just carry him to the Capital! We have to do something now!"
Earthbender captain says: "I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely."
Katara says: "It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait."
Zuko says: "The Avatar!"
Aang says: "Whoa!"
Katara says: "You're back!  Where's Sokka?"
Aang says: "I'm not sure ..."
Earthbender captain says: "These dangerous hands must be crushed."
Iroh says: "Excellent form, Prince Zuko."
Zuko says: "You taught me well."
Earthbender captain says: "Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered."
Iroh says: "Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched."
Zuko says: "Now would you please put on some clothes?"
