Aang says: "I just can't stand by and do nothing!"
Sokka says: "Aang, no!  You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this."
Aang says: "Fine."
Toph says: "How are we doing?"
Sokka says: "Things couldn't get much worse.  The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?"
Toph says: "You make it too easy!"
Sokka says: "Thank you, the universe!"
Toph says: "Hey, Aang! We're going into town to find some dinner."
Aang says: "Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea."
Sokka says: "Here,  tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow."
Aang says: "I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly!"
Sokka says: "Aang, come on. Be practical."
Katara says: "You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you.  I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed."
Aang says: "You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!"
Katara says: "Aang, that's not true."
Aang says: "It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good."
Katara says: "It's not for good.  Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!"
Aang says: "And I hate the invasion plan, too!  I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone."
Katara says: "Aang ..."
Aang says: "Katara, please! Just go ... please."
Katara says: "Is there anything you need?"
Aang says: "I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back."
Katara says: "I brought you some food!  Oh no ..."
