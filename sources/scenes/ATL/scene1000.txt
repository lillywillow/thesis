Katara says: "I need to borrow Appa."
Aang says: "Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?"
Katara says: "Yes, it is."
Aang says: "Oh. What's going on?"
Katara says: "We're going to find the man who took my mother from me."
Zuko says: "Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it and I know how to find him."
Aang says: "Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish?"
Katara says: "Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand."
Aang says: "Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?"
Zuko says: "She needs this, Aang. This is about getting closure and justice."
Aang says: "I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge."
Katara says: "Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves!"
Aang says: "Katara, you sound like Jet."
Katara says: "It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster."
Sokka says: "Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right."
Katara says: "Then you didn't love her the way I did!"
Sokka says: "Katara!"
Aang says: "The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself."
Zuko says: "That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool. It's the real world."
Katara says: "Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice."
Aang says: "Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness."
Zuko says: "That's the same as doing nothing!"
Aang says: "No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive."
Katara says: "It's not just hard, it's impossible."
