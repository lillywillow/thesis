Katara says: "Aang? Aang! Wake up.  It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready.  Everyone's waiting to meet you."
Katara says: "Aang, this is the entire village.  Entire village, Aang."
Aang says: "Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?"
Kanna says: "Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you."
Aang says: "Extinct?"
Katara says: "Aang, this is my grandmother."
Kanna says: "Call me Gran-Gran."
Sokka says: "What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this!"
Aang says: "It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending."
Village girl says: "Magic trick! Do it again!"
Aang says: "Not magic, airbending.  It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly."
Sokka says: "Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly!"
Aang says: "Check again!"
Village girl says: "He's flying!"
Village girl says: "It's amazing!"
Sokka says: "My watchtower!"
Katara says: "That was amazing!"
Sokka says: "Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long."
Aang says: "You're a waterbender?"
Katara says: "Well, sort of. Not yet."
Kanna says: "All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores."
Katara says: "I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me!"
Kanna says: "Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy."
Katara says: "But he's special! I can tell!  I sense he's filled with much wisdom."
Aang says: "See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!"
