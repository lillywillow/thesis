Zhao says: "This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.  Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it."
Iroh says: "Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects."
Zhao says: "I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se."
Iroh says: "I hope not, for your sake."
Zhao says: "Tell the captains to prepare for first strike."
Iroh says: "We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?"
Zuko says: "I'm working on it, Uncle."
Sokka says: "What's wrong?  We have to go!"
Yue says: "No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all."
Sokka says: "What? We're just friends."
Yue says: "I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else!"
Sokka says: "You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him."
Yue says: "But I do love my people."
Sokka says: "You're not marrying them."
Yue says: "You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye."
